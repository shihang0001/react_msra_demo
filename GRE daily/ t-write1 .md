there are some that argue that speding money and lastign things ismore worhewhile than sopeding money on short-term and the pleasure while i can see why people may think this i have to disaggree
first of all the enjoyment derieved from thing does not necessarily when we fisrt outsat the enjoyment that comes from experiences we might feel a sort of rush when we first buy something but that pleasure fades very quickly experiences on the other hand seem particular topic ad have been conducted there arestudies showing that giving gist for oneself this is seems to confirm that people can getmoreout of experience than they can get out of owning that people can get more out od experiences than they oneself then it would be resonable to assume that one coulf get more overall joy from say taking a trip tp prtu than from buyin an expensive pari of earrings.
second of all, because the pleasure we get frim buy objects lasts sucha a short time, perferentially spending. we will also satrt  to measure our hapiness ad our worth by the quantity of our processions this is surely in an unheally studies have sbhow that the none basic need and the met the haponies one get firrm buting tghingsghow severly diminishe returnm ad thus shpuf acoid an the plcaiong mih value iand obe the object and learn to cherish experinces nstednd 
Gerantde in certain situation buting obejcxt can have a deep and lating and impact on a person specilly it tend to happen when people buy meantingful things for other  for exaple a friend oonce agure that even is such situation it is realy the experience of giving and receing the gist that bring and the happines and not necesssarily the obejt itself se i woyu stiulll maintain that spending moent one the experience is gernerallyt better than spedning money on the obejct.
