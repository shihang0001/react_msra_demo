00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.723 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thank you so much

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.191 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
for helping me get to the

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.693 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Keynote.  I can't thank you

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.594 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
enough.  

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.764 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; Listen.  The least I can

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.065 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
do.  What are you going to talk

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.034 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
about?  Is there any insider

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.669 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
information you can give me?  

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.536 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: We are going to

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:40.040 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
talk about some great stuff.  

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.575 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; Right.  That just sounds

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:42.676 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
like a press release.  Is this

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
true?  I have read that the

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.582 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
security on the new iPhone is

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.250 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
going to be the best of its

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.684 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
kind.  

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.518 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Absolutely.  

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.421 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; Do you know how I read t

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:54.655 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
that?  

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.455 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: How?  

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.190 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; A leak on the Internet.  Do

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.326 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you see the irony of that?  

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.028 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: I do see the

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
irony of that.  

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.297 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; Who is your favorite band? 

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.134 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: I love

(Singing) 

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.888 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: Siri, what do

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.223 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
you think of Tim Cook?  

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:33.260 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; SIRI: He's wonderful, but

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.227 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
scheduling his appointments is

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.596 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
crazy.  

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.631 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: Siri, what do

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:41.034 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you think of James Corden?  

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.235 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; SIRI: This is about you,

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:42.669 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
not me.  

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.772 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.074 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: What are you

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:49.042 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
going to wear for the launch?  

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.077 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: I was planning on

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.346 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
just wearing what I've got on

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:53.080 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
here.  

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.714 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: This is a big

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:54.147 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
deal.  

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:54.648 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: I know.  

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:55.749 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: If I was you,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.284 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
I would be like wearing a suit

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:01.455 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
made entirely of apples or

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.359 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
maybe a cane with an Apple logo

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.595 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
on the top, shades.  You walk

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.564 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
on and go, this is it, bitches.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:12.232 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
 Get in line.  

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:12.532 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.568 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Hang on.  I know someone who

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:15.635 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
knows a thing or two about

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:20.173 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
fashion.  Hang on.  

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.043 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.044 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: That was

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
quick.  

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.980 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.148 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: You've got

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.049 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
some shades.  That's what I am

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.150 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
saying.  

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.052 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: What do you th

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:32.285 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
think?  

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:32.886 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: Already you

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.154 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
are changing up Apple every

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.789 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
single day.  I think we should

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.090 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
listen to some music and we

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.625 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
should listen to a song all

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.227 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
about where you are from.

 (Singing) 

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: All right. 

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.889 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Here we are.  Have a great one.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:09.022 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:10.824 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: Remember

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:12.059 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
everything I said, confidence,

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.894 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a couple of jokes, get out of

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:14.594 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
there.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 &gt;&gt; JAMES CORDEN: I am rooting

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:23.870 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
for you.  Here we go.  Tim C

James got me here on time.  And

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.635 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
it was so much fun seeing he

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.571 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and Pharrell, I may have lost

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.538 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
my voice.  

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.842 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 As you may know, we are

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:04.544 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.586 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
singing will have a voice much

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
better than mine.  

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.090 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 We've got some great things to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.158 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
share with you this morning,

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:19.593 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and I'd like to get started

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.529 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
with a few updates.  Beginning

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:26.166 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
with Apple Music.  As you know,

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.068 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
we've always had a deep love

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:31.271 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.008 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
it's such a gee part of our

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.109 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
product experience.  Since

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.145 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
launch, Apple Music has grown

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.480 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.647 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%

 (Applause) 

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:46.553 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%

people who really know and love

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.265 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.567 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 There's a great new simple and

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.145 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Music has content that no one

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.481 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
else has.  Apple Music has

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.384 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
become the premiere destination

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.994 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
first place to hear over 70

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.797 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%

Drake, Frank Ocean, and so many

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.137 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
more.  

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:38.138 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:45.478 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Thank you.  One of our most

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:49.616 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
pop popular inclusives of all

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.685 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
is the Apple Music festival in

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.086 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
London, and it begins just

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.521 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
three days from now.  This

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.689 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
great event has become a great

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.625 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
tradition that our customers

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.626 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
look forward to every year. 

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:02.362 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
This year we are celebrating

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.030 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the tenth anniversary of the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.298 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Apple Music festival, and we

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:08.101 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
have an amazing lineup.  This

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.338 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
year includes Elton John,

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:16.309 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
OneRepublic, Britney Spears,

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.812 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and so many more artists.  It's

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:20.113 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
going to be amazing.  If you

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.514 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
can't make it to London, you

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:22.816 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
can join the millions that will

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.084 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
be watching it for free on the

TV.  

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.026 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 That's a brief update on Apple

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.628 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Music.  It just keeps getting

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:35.028 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
better.  

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:35.362 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:43.403 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Now I'd like to talk about the

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.672 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
App Store.  Apps continue to do

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.774 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
more and more amazing things,

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:52.078 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
from allowing you to rent that

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.947 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
spare bedroom to contributing

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.382 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to advanced medical research. 

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:56.583 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
The App Store has forever

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.218 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
changed the world of software

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.620 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
and forever changed all of our

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.657 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
lives, and the momentum for

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.558 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
apps in the App Store have

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:09.596 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
never been greater.  Over 140

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.630 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
billion apps have now been

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.266 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
downloaded from the App Store. 

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:13.867 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:18.638 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 This is phenomenal.  And

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:19.673 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
what's even more phenomenal is

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:22.676 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
we continue to set new records,

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:24.577 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and the growth is literally off

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:27.947 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the charts.  In fact, in the

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.616 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
last two months, we've seen

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.052 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
growth rates of over 100% year

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.788 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
on year.  This is unbelievable.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.657 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 It's pretty clear from this

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.527 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
that our users' love affair

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.228 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
with apps for their iPhone and

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.597 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
iPad is as strong as ever.  

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.033 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Now, the most recent quarter

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.968 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the App Store generated twice

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.904 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
the global revenue of our n

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:53.273 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
nearest competitor.  This is

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:55.809 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
really great for developers,

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.744 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
and it's why that so many

00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:01.614 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
developers develop first on iOS

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:03.750 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
and many only on iOS.  And

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.051 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
this, of course, is great for

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.555 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
our users.  The combination of

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:10.924 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
our incredible products and the

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
success of the App Store has

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.662 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
made the iPhone and the iPad

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.031 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the most popular gaming devices

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:24.237 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
in the world.  And gaming is

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:25.505 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the biggest and most popular

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.674 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
category on the Store, with

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.008 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
over a half a million games to

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.579 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
choose from.  

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.682 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 But there's been something --

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.618 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
or rather someone -- missing,

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:41.621 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and I am so happy to announce

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.189 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
today he is coming to the App

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.659 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
Store.  

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:57.871 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:02.008 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Welcome, Mario!  And please

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.043 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
welcome from Nintendo the

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:07.881 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
father of Mario, Shigeru

Miyamoto.  

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:12.719 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:18.558 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.059 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; SHIGERU MIYAMOTO: Hello. 

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.129 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Good morning, everyone.  Thank

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.266 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
you, Tim.  

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:31.004 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 For the past 30 years, every

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.473 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
time Mario has encountered a

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:39.312 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
new platform, he has evolved

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.415 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and continued running towards a

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.185 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
new goal.  And now, Mario is

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:49.556 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
running towards his next goal,

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:50.590 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
iPhone.  

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.394 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.696 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 Please let me speak in

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.132 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Japanese, so I would like to

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:04.737 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
ask Bill Trinen to translate.  

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:09.175 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 We want as many people as

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.577 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
possible all around the world

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.645 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to be able to enjoy playing as

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Mario, and they will be doing

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.050 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
it first on iOS.  And they will

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.453 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
be doing it in a brand-new g

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:25.258 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
game, Super Mario Run.  

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:31.498 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 The magic of Mario is that

00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:32.665 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
anyone can pick up a game and

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.868 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
instantly start playing, and

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.269 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
this time we've made it even

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.672 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
simpler to begin.  So, why

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:45.979 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
don't we show you how.  Now, as

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.181 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the title suggests, Mario runs

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.050 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
automatically to the right. 

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.686 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
And as he does, he will hurdle

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.855 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
small gaps and certain enemies.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.057 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 It's very simple, and the

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:01.094 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
movement feels great.  With

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.129 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
just the tap of a finger a

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.163 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
anywhere on the touchscreen,

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.999 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you can make Mario jump, and

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.667 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the longer you tap, the higher

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.802 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
he jumps.  This is key to

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.605 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
getting high scores.  In later

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.173 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
levels, you will see blocks

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.174 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
that will change Mario's

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:17.744 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
direction and others that will

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:19.045 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
start and stop him with

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
precision timing.  But the goal

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.715 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
remains simple:  Collect as

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:23.583 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
many coins as you can and get

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.251 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to the flagpole at the end of

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:28.154 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the level before time runs out.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:33.626 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 But what's new this time,

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:34.561 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
what's different, is that you

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:36.029 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
can play the game one-handed

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.664 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for the very first time.  What

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:39.098 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that means is that you can play

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:41.467 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
while holding on to a handle on

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.235 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
the subway.  

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:44.203 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.806 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 While eating a hamburger.  

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.241 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.177 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Or while eating an apple.  

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.512 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:55.882 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:11:55.882 --> 00:12:01.588 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 But in addition to the

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.622 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
traditional Mario gameplay,

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:05.558 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
we've also prepared a brand-new

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.194 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
way to play.  It's a new battle

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:13.333 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
mode called Toad Rally.  And

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.501 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the first thing that you do in

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.703 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
battle mode is you choose an

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.438 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
opponent from this list to try

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:19.305 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to beat their high score. 

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:22.609 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Today I've ask Hideki to play

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:24.611 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
for me, so who should he

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.347 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
compete against?  Looks like he

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:31.951 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
picked Phil.  So we are going

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.854 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to try to beat Phil's high

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:38.491 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
score.  

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Now, battle mode will have you

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.661 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
competing not only against your

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.896 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
friends, but for the first t

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
time, players around the world.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.202 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 The victory in battle mode is

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:50.603 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
determined based on the number

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.671 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
of coins you collect and the

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
number of toads you impress,

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:54.841 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
because the toad characters

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.242 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
appear every time you do a

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:59.679 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
daring move.  There's no

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.214 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
flagpole in the battle mode, so

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:02.749 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you just keep running, jumping,

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:06.619 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and collecting coins until time

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.621 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
runs out.  As you do, you may

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.389 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
see a little sticker of Mario

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:11.557 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
moving through the course.  In

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:13.359 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
this case, that shows us what

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:15.228 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Phil was doing on his run,

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.063 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
where he collected his coins,

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:18.598 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
and where he gathered his toad

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:20.633 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
fans.  

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.802 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 In the matches that you win,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.370 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the toads you gather will

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.105 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
become residents of your very

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:29.142 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
own mushroom kingdom.  So

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.245 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
another new element you can

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:33.146 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
enjoy is expanding and

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.981 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
customizing your mushroom k

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:35.882 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
kingdom using the coins you

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:38.117 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
collect in the game.  

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:41.854 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Oh, at the end of battle mode,

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.390 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Toadette appears to tally the

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.761 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
score and show who won.  Good

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.162 align:start line:85% position:50% size:16%
job!  

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.697 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:56.436 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
 Sorry, sorry, Phil.  

00:13:56.436 --> 00:14:05.745 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 We want as many people of all

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:07.246 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
ages to be able to enjoy

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.749 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
playing Super Mario Run.  For

00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:11.884 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
that reason, we plan on

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
releasing the game at a set

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.988 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
price, so you won't have to

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.156 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
worry about continuing to pay. 

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.092 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
You will just be able to play

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to your heart's content.  

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.661 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:26.099 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 We'll announce pricing later,

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
but Super Mario Run will

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.402 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
release in time for holidays in

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:32.972 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
2016.  I hope you look forward

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:33.740 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
to it.  

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.778 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:44.817 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
We have one more piece of news.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:48.121 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 We've prepared a set of Super

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:52.191 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Mario sickers for iMessage that

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.092 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
will launch day and date with

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.327 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
iOS 10 that I hope you will

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.928 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
send to all your friends and

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.030 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
family.  In the meantime, you

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.899 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
can look forward to Super Mario

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.202 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Run.  Thank you very much.  

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.171 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.543 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thank you.  Thank

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:15.748 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you, Miyamoto-San.  We could

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.550 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
not be more honored that

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.086 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Nintendo chose to bring Mario

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.221 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to iOS first.  So that's a

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.590 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
brief update on the App Store. 

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.859 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, as we start a new school

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.128 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
year, let's turn our attention

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:33.666 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to education.  Apple celebrated

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:37.103 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
its 40th birthday earlier this

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.805 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
year, and it's no coincidence

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.239 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
that we've been committed to

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:43.743 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
education for that entire time.

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:45.878 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 It's simply deep in our DNA. 

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.114 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
We've always believed that

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.149 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
education is a great equalizer.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.119 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 It's a powerful force of

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.788 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
change for good.  And we've

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.690 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
always believed that our

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.325 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
products could have a

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
tremendous positive impact on

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.096 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
teachers and students.  But we

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.233 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
are keenly aware that not every

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:09.168 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
school can have this impact. 

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.770 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
And that's why we are so deeply

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
committed to ConnectED. 

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.708 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
ConnectED, as you probably k

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.877 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
know, is a national initiative

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.212 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
combining government and

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:22.215 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
leading technologies to bring

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.316 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
-- leading technology companies

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:28.187 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
to bring technology to

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:28.688 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
underserved schools.  

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.256 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 I personally visited several

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:31.624 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
of these ConnectED schools, and

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:32.758 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the program is having amazing

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:35.094 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
results.  Kids are engaged like

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:36.362 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
never before.  They are

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.798 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
learning like never before.  It

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:40.132 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
is as it should be.  

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:42.101 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We are proud this morning to

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.836 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
have some ConnectED teachers

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.172 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and students join us, and I'd

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.741 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
like you to welcome them from

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:53.312 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Santee Elementary in San Jose

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:54.647 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
and Stege Elementary from

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.148 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Richmond, California.  Please

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.484 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
join me in welcoming them.  

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:06.859 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:13.499 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
And I am thrilled to tell you

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.269 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
that this fall all 114 schools

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.303 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that Apple is supporting will

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:21.140 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
be up and running.  That means

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.143 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
we are giving a Mac and an iPad

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.879 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to 4500 teachers, an Apple TV

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.514 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in every classroom, and we are

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.182 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
donating iPads to more than

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.984 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
50,000 students.  

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:32.318 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:35.655 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
 Thank you.  

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:41.294 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, the response has been so

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:44.430 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
inspiring.  Trina Siegfried

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.533 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
from Crane Elementary in Yuma,

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:50.536 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Arizona, told us this:  The

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:51.871 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
kecd Ed grant meant a complete

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:52.805 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
transformation.  The students

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.206 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
are having fun.  They're more

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.309 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
engaged.  Most importantly, we

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.945 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
are seeing a real love of

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.346 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
learning.  That is as it should

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:01.814 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
be.  We can't wait to see what

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.449 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
these kids are going to do this

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:05.518 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
school year, and we are so very

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:08.254 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
proud to be a part of it.  

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.656 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 But we are not stopping there.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.058 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 We believe every student

00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:14.260 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
should have the opportunity to

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.829 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
code.  So we've created a

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:17.697 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
program called Everyone Can

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:20.232 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Code.  It's Apple's approach to

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.201 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
teaching coding, and it's a

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.804 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
cornerstone of ConnectED.  It

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.606 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
starts with the amazing iPad

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.442 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
app Swift Playgrounds, which we

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.377 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
just announced in June.  And

00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:33.813 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
what this does is it teaches

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.581 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Swift, our popular programming

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.550 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
language, to all of these kids

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.019 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
in a simple, fun, and

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:41.721 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
interactive way.  

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:45.157 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Already, since June, more than

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.225 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
100 schools and school

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.761 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
districts around the world have

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:50.730 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
already planned to teach Swift

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.766 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Playgrounds this fall.  It's

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:55.167 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
unbelievably exciting to us.  

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.802 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:02.708 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 We are so excited that they

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.243 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
moved to put this in their

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.312 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
curriculum so, so quickly.  

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.314 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Now, I'd like to talk to you

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.649 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
about one other very important

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
tool in education, and that is

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.756 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
iWork.  Of course, iWork

00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:17.990 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
provides a suite of

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.258 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
productivity tools which are

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.927 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
very popular in education but

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:24.196 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
also in business and consumers.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.832 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 Teachers and students love

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.068 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
creating stunning documents and

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:30.836 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
presentations and even

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.172 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
spreadsheets.  I'd like to

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:36.308 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
invite Susan Prescott, our Vice

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.478 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
President of Worldwide Apps

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:41.313 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Product Markets to tell you

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:42.848 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
what's next with iWork.  Susan?

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.482 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:44.517 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.552 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:49.755 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%
 &gt;&gt; SIRI: 

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.423 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:51.257 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 &gt;&gt; SUSAN PRESCOTT: Thank you,

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:53.659 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
Tim.  Thank you.  Pages,

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:55.261 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Keynote, and Numbers are built

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:57.296 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
to take advantage of iOS,

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.697 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
macOS, and of course, our

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:00.199 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
amazing devices.  And iWork is

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.701 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
all about making beautiful and

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.872 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
engaging documents.  But for

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.207 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
people who want the power of

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.642 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
iWork, there is just not a

00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:12.978 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
great way for them to work with

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.381 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
classmates or colleagues to

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:21.787 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
create projects together.  But

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.289 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
today I'm very excited to

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:25.724 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
announce and introduce

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
real-time collaboration.  

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.561 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:34.300 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 In all of the iWork apps, the

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.735 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
exact same apps you use on your

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.438 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Mac, iPad, and iPhone.  Of

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.308 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
course, we use them too, even

00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:44.643 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
our big presentations like this

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:47.413 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
one are built using Keynote,

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:51.517 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
which got me thinking we could

00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:54.920 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
edit slides right here right

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.323 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
now.  We have never edited a

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:59.825 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
deck live on stage before.  I

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.627 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
think the reasons are obvious. 

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:02.094 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:05.297 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 But we are so excited to show

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:07.166 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
you our real-time collab

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:07.766 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
collaboration, we're going to

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.235 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
do it.  

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:12.171 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:17.743 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
So we'll start by hitting

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.345 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Escape to go from play mode

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:21.147 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
into edit mode so we can add a

00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:22.481 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
couple of slides about

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.451 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
collaboration.  If I go to the

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.219 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Participants list, I can see my

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.654 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
colleagues I've already invited

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:30.389 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to work on the deck with me. 

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.759 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
We've got Greg, Lesley,

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.394 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Michelle, and Rodney.  They

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.662 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
each have a color associated

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.930 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
with them, so when they

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.165 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
actually begin editing, you

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:40.733 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
will see a colored bubble come

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:43.202 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
up with their name.  Now, get

00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:44.670 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
ready because we are going to

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
be adding images, graphics,

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:51.777 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
text, and even animations all

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:52.645 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
in real time.  

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.715 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 I am going to start by adding

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:58.684 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a slide.  Lesley can bring in

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.819 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
an image.  That one looks

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:06.325 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
perfect.  And Michelle can add

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.993 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
a graphic of an iPad.  That

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.261 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
would be ideal.  That looks

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:10.362 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
great.  I think you get the

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.864 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
idea.  So let's watch as

00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:13.666 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
everybody gets to work.  

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:16.335 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Remember, this is happening

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.903 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
live.  And look how super

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:21.540 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
responsive it is, even with the

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.875 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
beautiful visuals that make

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:24.643 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iWork documents stand out.  And

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
you can work from your Mac,

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:29.281 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
your iPad, your iPhone, or even

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:32.551 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the Web.  It's amazing.  

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:35.421 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 I see in the thumbnails that

00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:36.855 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Greg's added a new slide, which

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.191 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
is fantastic, and of course, we

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.727 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
are collaborating together, so

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:44.697 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
I can also edit anything here. 

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:47.266 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
But it looks like we are about

00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:50.669 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
ready, so let's take a look. 

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:56.408 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
You ready?  Wow.  That looks

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:58.711 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
amazing, and it could only

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
happen working together.  

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:06.085 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:09.188 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
That is just a very quick look

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:11.190 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
at real-time collaboration in

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.524 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
iWork.  It will change the way

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:14.226 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
you work with classmates, with

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.195 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
colleagues, and with friends. 

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:17.263 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
You're gonna love it.  Thank

00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:18.697 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
you so much.  

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:19.265 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%

 Town

00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:30.743 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks, Susan.  

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.244 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So that's a little bit about

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.112 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
education and some things that

00:23:33.112 --> 00:23:34.313 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
are important to us.  I'd now

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:38.150 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
like to turn to new products

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
beginning with Apple Watch.  

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.620 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.725 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 We started shipping Apple

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:49.261 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Watch just 18 months ago, and

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.729 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
already people all over the

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:53.232 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
world are using it in many

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:57.202 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
aspects of their daily lives. 

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.804 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
It's the best way to get

00:23:58.804 --> 00:23:59.705 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
notifications so you don't miss

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.906 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
that urgent phone call or

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:01.907 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
message.  You can quickly and

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.909 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
conveniently pay for things

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.411 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
with Apple Pay.  And we

00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:07.212 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
couldn't be happier that so

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:08.847 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
many people are using it to

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:12.451 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
become more active and healthy.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.053 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Apple Watch has really changed

00:24:14.053 --> 00:24:19.525 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
what people expect from a wa

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:20.092 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
watch.  Before Apple Watch,

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:21.994 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
these were the top watch brands

00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:24.630 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
in the world as measured by

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.865 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
sales revenue.  This is what

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.767 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
happened after we launched

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:32.705 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
Apple Watch.  

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:35.107 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:41.547 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 We became the number two watch

00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:42.748 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
brand in the world, despite

00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:46.518 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
only shipping 8 months of 2015.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.654 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 We are also the top selling

00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:50.689 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
smartwatch, but as everyone

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:52.958 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
knows in here, what's really

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
important to us is that we

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.262 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
delight our customers, and I am

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:59.064 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
pleased to tell you that

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:01.400 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
customers love the Apple Watch.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.669 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 Survey after survey, Apple

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:06.772 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
Watch tops number one in

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:08.307 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
customer satisfaction,

00:25:08.307 --> 00:25:11.377 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
including the most recent JD

00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:13.245 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
Power smartwatch study.  

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.415 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, so Apple Watch has set a

00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:20.786 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
very high bar about what a

00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:21.754 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
modern watch can be, but we are

00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:23.989 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
just getting started.  And to

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:26.692 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
tell you about what is next

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:28.327 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with Apple Watch, I'd like to

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:30.496 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
invite Jeff Williams up.  Jeff?

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:30.729 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:36.902 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:40.706 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JEFF WILLIAMS: Thanks, Tim.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:42.374 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 We've got a lot to talk about,

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.275 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
so let's get started.  

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:46.278 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 In June, we previewed watchOS

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:48.580 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
3, and it is packed with

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.682 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
features.  Your favorite apps

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:51.784 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
launch instantly with

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:53.385 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
information already up-to-date

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.686 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
so they are ready when you need

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.688 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
them.  There's a new dock so

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:57.756 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
you can quickly access your

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.291 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
favorite apps.  And we've made

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.226 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
it easier than ever to switch

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.529 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
watch faces.  You just swipe

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:07.299 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
edge to edge.  And we've added

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.534 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
some great new faces, like

00:26:08.534 --> 00:26:09.802 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
these activity ones.  

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.203 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Messaging is more expressive

00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:13.672 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
than ever with features like

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:14.773 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
tap back, where you double-tap

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:17.943 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a message to send a quick re

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.845 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
reply.  There are fun animated

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:23.182 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
stickers.  You've just got to

00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:24.817 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
love Donald Duck.  And you can

00:26:24.817 --> 00:26:26.585 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
enjoy full-screen effects like

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.387 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
confetti to celebrate special

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:32.357 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
moments.  You can also write

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:36.395 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
custom replies with Scribble. 

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:37.729 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
And for those of you who are

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:38.897 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
skeptical, which is probably a

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.166 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
lot of you, about writing on

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.734 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the small screen, you should

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.970 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
try it.  You will be amazed how

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.172 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
well it works.  And it works in

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.676 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
-- (Applause) -- thank you,

00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:51.877 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Eddy.  And it works in both

00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:53.445 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
simplified and traditional

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.213 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
Chinese as well.  

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:57.282 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We've added activity sharing

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.417 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to the Watch, closing the rings

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:00.118 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
is already this fun, healthy

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.287 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
obsession, and now you can

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:03.188 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
share with your friends and

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.157 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
family and encourage them to be

00:27:05.157 --> 00:27:06.959 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
more active.  We have a

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:10.696 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
brand-new app called Breathe. 

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:13.131 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Each day it reminds you to take

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:15.067 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
a moment and do a d

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:15.968 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
deep-breathing exercise.  It's

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:17.870 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
a great way to be more mindful

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.372 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and manage everyday stress.  

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.874 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 And we've added a really

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:23.108 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
important app, it's a safety

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.811 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
feature that allows you to

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:26.745 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
contact emergency services by

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.680 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
simply pressing and holding the

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.249 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
side button.  Within seconds,

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:32.651 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
you will be on a call with 911

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
or the equivalent number in the

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.321 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
country you are in, and in

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:36.989 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
addition, a message will be

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:39.525 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
sent to your emergency con

00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:40.292 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
contacts, along with your

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:41.693 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
location, so they are in a

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.762 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
better position to assist you. 

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:44.696 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
This is something we hope you

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.266 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
never use, but it's really

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.468 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
comforting to know it's there. 

00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:53.639 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:58.844 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
In addition to all these great

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.312 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
built-in apps, developers have

00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:02.548 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
been hard at work already on

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:06.618 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
watchOS 3.  So apps like the

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.153 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
Washington Post and Major

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.721 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
League Soccer, they launch

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.590 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
instantly with information

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.992 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
already up-to-date.  Gaming

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:14.660 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
apps like Field Day take

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.627 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
advantage of the powerful

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:17.763 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
graphics tools in watchOS 3,

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:19.665 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
like SceneKit and SpriteKit. 

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:21.934 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Fitness apps like Sweat with

00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:27.172 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Kayla and P90x have access to

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:28.674 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
real-time heart rate.  And Ping

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:31.176 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
will use the gyroscope to

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:33.145 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
analyze and hopefully improve

00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:35.180 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
your golf swing.  

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.150 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 So, so many great apps, but

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.786 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
there's one special one that I

00:28:40.786 --> 00:28:45.357 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
am excited to tell you about

00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:48.226 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
today.  Pokemon Go is coming to

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:49.561 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
the Watch.  

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.963 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:54.333 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 And to tell you more about it,

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:57.135 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
I'd like to invite to the stage

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:02.274 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
John Hanke, CEO of Niantic L

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:02.507 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
Labs.  

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.643 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; JOHN HANKE: Thank you, J

00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:04.876 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
Jeff.  

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.812 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Well, it's certainly been a

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.715 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
busy summer for us at Niantic

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.850 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and also for our friends at the

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.418 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Pokemon Company.  I hope many

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.587 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
of you have had a chance to try

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:16.955 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Pokemon Go for iPhone.  If you

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:19.925 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
have, you are not alone.  Since

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.761 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
we launched in early July,

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:25.430 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Pokemon Go has been downloaded

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.932 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
more than 500 million times

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:28.300 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
around the world.  

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.434 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 More importantly, Pokemon

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.943 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
trainers collectively have

00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:40.879 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
walked more than 4.6 billion

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.681 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
kilometers while playing the

00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:43.682 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
game.  

00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:46.618 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:51.890 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 So, Pokemon Go is about

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.924 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
exploration.  It's also about

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:54.292 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
having fun outside with your

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:55.227 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
family or with your friends. 

00:29:55.227 --> 00:29:56.862 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
And because of that, we have

00:29:56.862 --> 00:30:01.099 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
been really interested to f

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.334 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
finding ways that enable you to

00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:03.468 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
play while focusing less on

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.469 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
your screen and more on the

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.871 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
stuff around you.  That was the

00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:08.507 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
inspiration for this device,

00:30:08.507 --> 00:30:09.708 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the Pokemon Go Plus developed

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:11.910 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
by our partners at Nintendo. 

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.212 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
It works with your iPhone to

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:16.415 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
enable heads-up gameplay for

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:18.216 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Pokemon Go, and it will be

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:21.753 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
available later this month.  

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.121 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 This morning, we are really

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.723 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
excited to show you something

00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
new that we've been working on.

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.428 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 It's designed to seamlessly

00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:30.962 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
blend Pokemon Go gameplay with

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:34.332 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
your daily walk or run while

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.435 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
enabling you to focus on what's

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.170 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
important, all the cool stuff

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.139 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
around you.  Pokemon Go on

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.307 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
Apple Watch.  

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:49.414 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 I want to introduce the

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:53.552 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
project manager from Pokemon 

00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:54.152 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Go, Tatsuo Nomura, to give you

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:56.388 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
a demo.  

00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:56.988 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; TATSUO NOMURA: Thank you,

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.757 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
John.  For Pokemon trainers out

00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:00.759 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
there, sometimes Pokemon can

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:03.261 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
hatch from the egg by walking

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:05.197 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
with it.  Good news.  From a

00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:06.231 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
complication on the watch face,

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.966 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
I can see how far I need to

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.367 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
walk to hatch an egg.  The main

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:13.371 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
screen shows my current level

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.806 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and XP I need to get to the

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.875 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
next.  My walk is recorded as a

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.776 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
workout because it helps me

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:19.678 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
make faster progress towards my

00:31:19.678 --> 00:31:20.879 align:start line:85% position:48% size:43%
activity goals.  

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.882 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 All right.  Let's take a walk.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:26.752 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 During my walk, I can see how

00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:28.286 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
far I walked and the calories

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:32.390 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
burned.  At a glance, I see

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.391 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
which Pokemon are nearby.  So

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:36.795 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
let's keep walking.  A wild

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:39.164 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
snorlax appeared!  

00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:39.464 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:42.300 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 Ah, if it wasn't for this

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.301 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
demo, I definitely would have

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.470 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
taken out my iPhone to catch

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.872 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
it.  Oh, well.  Let's keep

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:49.841 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%
walking.  

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:53.912 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 When I approach a PokeStop, a

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.815 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
tap on my wrist lets me know. 

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:57.716 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
PokeStops are located at

00:31:57.716 --> 00:32:00.552 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
interesting places, such as

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
public art works and historical

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.423 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
landmarks.  This one is Bill

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:08.827 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Graham.  Interesting.  Let's

00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:11.363 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
collect some items.  I just

00:32:11.363 --> 00:32:14.699 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
swipe, sweet, I got an ultra

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.601 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
ball.  

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.437 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 With Pokemon Go on Apple Wa

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.540 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Watch, I will never miss a

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.207 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
PokeStop.  

00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:23.742 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Oh, I think I just earned a

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:25.744 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
gold medal.  This means I

00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:28.513 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
visited 2,000 PokeStops. 

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:29.948 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
That's pretty impressive.  

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:30.248 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:32.818 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 I am going to keep walking to

00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:37.389 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
see if I can hatch an egg.  Oh?

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:41.793 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Here we are.  Let's see what

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:48.667 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
hatches.  Yes, it's a Pikachu. 

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:49.835 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:54.206 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 Isn't that exciting?  

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:56.741 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Now that I've done walking,

00:32:56.741 --> 00:33:03.982 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
let's end my workout.  The

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.550 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
summary screen shows all my

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.085 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
activity and all the items I

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:10.455 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
collected along the way. 

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.757 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Pokemon Go on Apple Watch will

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:13.925 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
help you to be the very best. 

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:14.593 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
Thank you.  

00:33:14.593 --> 00:33:18.763 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:20.732 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JOHN HANKE: Thanks, Tatsuo.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.300 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 We are really excited to bring

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.402 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
you this new way to explore

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:27.873 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
Pokemon Go and get some

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:30.342 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
inspiration to get going, get

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:31.243 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
outside, and share with your

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:31.877 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
friends.  It will be shipping

00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.645 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
before end of year.  Thank you.

00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:33.778 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.981 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:38.283 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; JEFF WILLIAMS: Thanks, g

00:33:38.283 --> 00:33:39.384 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
guys.  I can't wait to get

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.786 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Pokemon Go for my Watch.  Maybe

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:42.821 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
I can finally break out of

00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:43.788 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
level 2 and catch up with my

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:44.589 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
daughter.  

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:46.258 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Whether it's Pokemon Go or the

00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:48.493 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
built-in apps, there are so

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
many rich features in watchOS

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:55.267 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
3, people are going to

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:56.668 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
absolutely love it.  

00:33:56.668 --> 00:33:57.068 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:07.245 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We are going to keep pushing

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:08.813 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Watch forward, and today I am

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:12.417 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
excited to introduce the next

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:15.620 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
generation of Apple Watch.  

00:34:15.720 --> 00:35:19.951 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
(Cheers and applause) 

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:28.159 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
We call it Apple Watch Series 

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.361 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
2, and it has been completely

00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.428 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
reengineered.  It starts with a

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:32.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
feature that will change how

00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:34.833 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you use Apple Watch.  The first

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:38.103 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Apple Watch was splash proof,

00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:39.838 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and Apple Watch Series 2 is

00:35:39.838 --> 00:35:41.673 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
swim proof.  

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:43.708 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:48.646 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So you can wear it whether you

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.883 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
are swimming or surfing or just

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:54.452 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
doing that occasional ca

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:55.820 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
cannonball.  You can keep it 

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.322 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
on.  It's rated water resistant

00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.357 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
50 meters, which is the

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.392 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
industry standard for a swim

00:36:00.392 --> 00:36:03.228 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
watch, but what that means is

00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:05.330 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the Watch needs to withstand

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.831 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the water pressure equivalent

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.366 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
of being at a depth of 50

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:11.236 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
meters, and that's pretty deep.

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:13.204 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 And it's especially chal

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:14.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
challenging for a smartwatch

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:16.674 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
because there are so many

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:19.344 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
ingress points.  So our

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.945 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
engineers have been hard at

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.781 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
work developing new seals and

00:36:22.781 --> 00:36:24.015 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
adhesives, and they have been

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.483 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
able to close all those entry

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:28.153 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
points except one -- the sp

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:31.256 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
speaker.  You see, a speaker

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:33.224 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
needs air to produce sound, and

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.393 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
if the air can get in, so can

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:37.662 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
the water, and that's a

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:40.498 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
problem.  So for Series 2, we

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:41.833 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
redesigned the speaker system,

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.235 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and at the end of your workout,

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:47.205 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
we use the speaker itself to

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:48.573 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
eject the water.  

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:54.846 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:36:54.946 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
We also wanted to make sure

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.021 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Apple Watch was robust enough

00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:04.355 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
not just for an occasional swim

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.224 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
but for people who want to swim

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:08.526 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
every day.  So we built a

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:11.596 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
simulator to test the effects

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:15.433 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
of swimming over multiple ye

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:20.438 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
years.  We put watches in

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:21.940 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
there, run them 24 hours a day

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.875 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
for weeks at a time, simulating

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:25.276 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
hundreds of thousands of

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:28.246 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
strokes, so you can wear your

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.747 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
watch with confidence in the

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.283 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
water.  

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:36.221 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We've also extended the work

00:37:36.221 --> 00:37:37.856 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
of our fitness lab to swimming.

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:39.924 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, calculating calorie burn

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for swimming is really tricky,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.697 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and we've analyzed over 700

00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:48.833 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
swimmers, different body types,

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:49.801 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
different abilities.  We've

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:51.970 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
hooked them up to st

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:52.504 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
state-of-the-art metabolic

00:37:52.504 --> 00:37:54.272 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
equipment.  We've even drawn

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.808 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
blood samples to look at lactic

00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:58.776 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
acid levels, and we used all

00:37:58.776 --> 00:37:59.878 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
this body of information to

00:37:59.878 --> 00:38:01.246 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
create an algorithm that will

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:02.614 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
give you the most accurate

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:03.581 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
calorie burn information while

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.450 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
you are swimming.  And we

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.751 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
created two new workouts, a

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
pool swim and an open water

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.390 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
swim, and during the workout,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.758 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you will get information like

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.693 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
lap count, pace, distance,

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:18.263 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
calorie burn.  What's more, the

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:19.764 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Watch will learn more about you

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.266 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
over time.  It will get more

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:22.967 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
accurate over time.  It looks

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:23.935 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
at your stroke efficiency, not

00:38:23.935 --> 00:38:25.270 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that of some average swimmer,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.437 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
and tailors just to you.  We

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
think swimmers are going to

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.107 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
absolutely love this.  

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:32.844 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:38.116 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:39.751 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the brains of Apple Watch

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:41.519 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Series 2, and it starts with

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:44.656 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
our second generation System in

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:47.258 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
Package.  Last year we

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.393 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
introduced an industry first,

00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:50.495 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
an entire system in a single

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:52.864 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
package, and S2 takes that to a

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:54.399 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
whole new level.  We've added a

00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:57.435 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
dual-core processor that's up

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:01.873 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to 50% faster.  We've added a

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:04.008 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
new, entirely new GPU that

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.411 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
delivers two times the graphics

00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:08.813 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
performance.  And this powerful

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:10.415 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
chip opens up all kinds of

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:12.450 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
opportunities, both for

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.785 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
internal apps as well as

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
developers.  For example, Night

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.456 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
Sky, which is an app that

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.458 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
allows you to identify the

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:21.459 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
planets and constellations and

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:22.460 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
track the International Space

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.895 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Station, they've been working

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.463 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
with S2, and they have been

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:26.531 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
able to add five times the

00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:28.433 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
level of detail and more than

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:29.534 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
double the frame rate.  They

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.270 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
are running it at 60 frames a

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.605 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
second, which is just a crazy

00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:34.472 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
amount of performance to be

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
wearing on your wrist.  

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.611 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:45.016 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Series 2 also features a new

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:46.050 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
second-generation display that

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.586 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
is more than two times brighter

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.756 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
than before.  It, in fact, is

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.858 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the brightest display Apple has

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:57.362 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
ever shipped on any product at

00:39:57.362 --> 00:39:59.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
1,000 nits.  That's a lot of

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:04.269 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
nits.  (Laughter).  And it

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:05.470 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
makes all the difference when

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.438 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you are outside in the bright

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.274 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
sunlight.  It really does. 

00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:10.708 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
Really vivid.  

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.944 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 Two of the most popular

00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:14.879 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
activities in the world are

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:17.315 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
walking and running, and we

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.816 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
know there's times that people

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:20.451 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
want to do this without their

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.921 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
phone, so for those times,

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.557 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
we've added built-in GPS.  

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:27.558 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:34.132 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 And this is really great.  You

00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:35.266 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
can start right away.  For

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:38.269 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
those of you who have used a

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.470 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
GPS watch before, you know it

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.571 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
can sometimes take a long time

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to connect to the satellites. 

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.974 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
It seems like forever when you

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:45.376 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
are getting ready to work out. 

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:45.910 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
With Apple Watch, you can

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.378 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
literally hit Start and begin

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:49.547 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
your workout.  During your w

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.516 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
workout, you will get G

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:52.417 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
GPS-accurate pace and distance.

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:54.686 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 And at the end of your w

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:56.321 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
workout, in the Activity app of

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:57.322 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
your phone, there will be a

00:40:57.322 --> 00:40:58.990 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
route map color coded to show

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.792 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
your varying speeds.  And

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.393 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
developers can take advantage

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:05.396 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
of the built-in GPS.  I'd like

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.464 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to give you an example of that.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:08.333 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 I would like to invite to the

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:12.570 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
stage Hannah Catmur, Lead

 (Applause) 

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:21.512 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; HANNAH CATMUR: Hi.  I am

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.915 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
here today to show you

00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:25.783 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
ViewRanger, the first-ever

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:26.818 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
hiking app on the new Apple

00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:29.420 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Watch, which gives you the

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.788 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
ability to join a hike like you

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.423 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
never have before.  So, I am

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:34.826 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
planning a trip to Yosemite.  I

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:36.361 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
have never been before, but I

00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:37.829 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
hear it's beautiful.  With

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.431 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
ViewRanger, I selected these

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:42.934 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
three hikes ahead of time. 

00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:43.868 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Apple Watch is made available

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.403 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
offline, which means I don't

00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:47.472 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
need cell service to know where

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:50.375 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
I am.  I have the Half Dome

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:52.276 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Cables on here, and at SHHH

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.278 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
miles, it's probably a bit

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
intense for this morning. 

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.349 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Let's take a look at the f

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.084 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
four-mile trail to Glacier

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Point.  Let's get going.  

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.123 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Here I can see my directions. 

00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:06.190 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
And I can also scroll through

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.458 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to see all of the exciting

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.427 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
views and destinations I have

00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:12.430 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
coming up.  At any time, I can

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
swipe right to check in on the

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.966 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
map.  I can see my current

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:16.501 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
location and my route progress.

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:19.904 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 In fact, anytime, if I stray

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.005 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
too far from the path,

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.507 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
ViewRanger will let me know

00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:26.677 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
about it.  This really wasn't

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.979 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
possible before, but now the

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:29.847 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Apple Watch has integrated GPS,

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.549 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
ViewRanger can look out to make

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:32.817 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
sure I don't stray too far off

00:42:32.817 --> 00:42:33.050 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
route.  

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.919 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 From here we can check in on

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.354 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the map.  We can get back on

00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:37.488 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
track, and we can continue with

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.823 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
the hike.  

00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:40.792 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So let's jump forward to about

00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:44.095 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
halfway to the view of yo

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:48.399 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Of Yosemite Falls.  With every

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.867 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
point of interest, ViewRanger

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.969 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
provides a quick fun fact.  So

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.604 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
let's tap into it.  Here we can

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.373 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
see that Yosemite Falls is

00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:56.474 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
actually a hot spot for bird

00:42:56.474 --> 00:42:57.909 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
watching, which is, in fact,

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.977 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
one of my favorite things to 

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:00.578 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
do.  Hopefully we will see a

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:02.380 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
read-tailed hawk on the way

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.881 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
towards the summit.  

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:05.450 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 Here we are in the final

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.919 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
sprint as we head towards

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:09.654 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Glacier Point.  ViewRanger k

00:43:09.654 --> 00:43:10.922 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
knows when I've reached the end

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:11.989 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
of the hike.  I then have the

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:13.357 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
option to either finish or to

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:16.194 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
keep going if I'd like.  We'll

00:43:16.194 --> 00:43:19.330 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
tap Finish.  My Activity rings

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.799 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
will fill up, and I am all set

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:24.335 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to enjoy the rest of Yosemite. 

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:26.337 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
That's ViewRanger, the fi

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.505 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
first-ever hiking app to take

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:28.806 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
advantage of the new GPS on

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:29.540 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Apple Watch.  We are really

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.042 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
excited for you guys to try it

00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:32.510 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
on your next hike.  Thank you.

Hannah.  

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:41.719 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So many opportunities with the

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.456 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
features of Series 2.  Series 2

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.824 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
comes in a wide variety of

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:50.728 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
styles.  We have cases in

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.897 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
aluminum and stainless steel,

00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:54.799 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
as well as a new material we've

00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:58.035 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
been working on for quite some

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:00.004 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
time, ceramic.  

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.405 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:09.847 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 This new white Apple Watch in

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:12.783 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
ceramic has this gorgeous pe

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:13.584 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
pearl-like shine.  The finish

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:14.952 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
is remarkably smooth.  It's

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:17.655 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
actually four times harder than

00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:18.990 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
stainless steel, so it's this

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.825 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
ultimate combination of beauty

00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and strength.  And it looks

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.529 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
great paired with a variety of

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:26.163 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
bands.  We think it's going to

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.565 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
be a wonderful addition to the

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
Apple Watch family.  

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.372 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 We also are offering Series 2

00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:36.707 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
in Hermes models.  Last year we

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.342 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
partnered with Hermes, a

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.344 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
company known for craftsmanship

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.947 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and elegance and style, and for

00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:45.216 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Series 2, there are beautiful

00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:47.552 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
new colors of the iconic double

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:49.587 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
tour and single tour, as well

00:44:49.587 --> 00:44:54.425 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
as two new bands, this si

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.059 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
single-tour deployment buckle,

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:57.395 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
and a new double-buckle cuff. 

00:44:57.395 --> 00:44:58.362 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
We think people are really

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.397 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
going to enjoy these.  

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:00.531 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:11.576 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So that's Apple Watch Series

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.110 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
2.  It is faster.  It is

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.345 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
brighter.  It is water

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:15.413 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
resistant so you can swim with

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:18.282 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
it.  It's got built-in GPS. 

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:20.351 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
And it's got all of the power

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:22.453 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
of watchOS 3.  It is also built

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:25.289 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
according to our strict

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:25.957 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
environmental standards,

00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:26.924 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
something we care deeply about.

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:28.593 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 This is made in a responsible

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.194 align:start line:85% position:50% size:16%
way.  

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.497 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 We think Apple Watch is the

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:36.100 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
ultimate device for a healthy

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.503 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
life, and we expect it to be

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:42.340 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
popular with everybody, but we

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.442 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
think it will be especially

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:47.011 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
popular with runners.  And we

00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:48.879 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
wanted to do something special

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:49.981 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
for them.  We couldn't think of

00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:51.916 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
a better way to do that than to

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:52.850 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
partner with a company that

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.519 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
knows runners better than

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.387 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
anyone else in the world.  They

00:45:56.387 --> 00:45:57.922 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
are the number one sports and

00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.857 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
fitness brand in the world, and

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:00.958 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
that is Nike.  

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:06.130 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:11.102 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
We've worked with Nike for over

00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:14.538 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a decade, and we couldn't be

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:20.244 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
more excited today to announce

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.379 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
Apple Watch Nike+.  

00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:23.714 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:29.020 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 It's a watch designed spe

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.087 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
specifically with runners in

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:31.822 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
mind.  It features this

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:33.958 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
beautiful perforated band

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:35.826 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
that's stretchy, it's light,

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:38.162 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
it's breathable.  It's paired

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.864 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with our lightweight aluminum

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:41.198 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
case, which is ideal for

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.401 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
running.  And we are so excited

00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:45.036 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
about it, and to tell you more

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:46.404 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
about this, I'd like to bring

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:49.774 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
to the stage Trevor Edwards,

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:51.876 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
President of the Nike brand.  

00:46:51.876 --> 00:47:00.685 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:01.752 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 &gt;&gt; TREVOR EDWARDS: Good

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:07.692 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
morning.  Whoo!  It's been such

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:09.026 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
a great partnership working

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.961 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
with Apple.  Apple and Nike

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.364 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
share a passion to make life

00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:16.233 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
easier and more fun, and we

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:18.502 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
look forward to continuing this

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.371 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
amazing journey together.  

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:23.074 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 Nike has always been about

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:26.143 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
inspiration and innovation for

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:28.813 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
every athlete, and it all began

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:30.981 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
40 years ago with a deep

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:33.150 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
relationship with runners, and

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.620 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
that obsession continues to

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.022 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
this day.  

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.092 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Today, sports and fitness are

00:47:41.092 --> 00:47:42.593 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
a bigger part of people's

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.562 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
lives, and more and more people

00:47:44.562 --> 00:47:46.797 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
want to get out and run.  But

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.999 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
getting started on your own and

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:52.169 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
staying motivated can be tough.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.571 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So, more and more people are

00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:56.507 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
looking for help and turning to

00:47:56.507 --> 00:47:58.342 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
running devices to actually

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:02.513 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
help them.  But these devices

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:04.882 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
are complex, they are clut

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:05.382 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
cluttered, and they are

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:09.086 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
difficult to use.  And, of

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:11.889 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
course, they don't support what

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.824 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a runner wants to do when he

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:14.992 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
just wants to get out and go

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.494 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
for a quick run.  It's a

00:48:16.494 --> 00:48:18.028 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
problem, and Nike and Apple

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:20.498 align:start line:85% position:48% size:43%
have solved it.  

00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:23.467 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 The Apple Watch Nike+.  This

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:26.036 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
isn't just a watch; it's your

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:28.472 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
perfect running partner.  It's

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:31.008 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
simple, it's fun, and it's easy

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:33.611 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
to use.  And we think it

00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:35.846 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
delivers the best -- the best

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.716 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
-- running experience that's

00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:40.417 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
out there.  Starting a run has

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.853 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
never been easier, and we give

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.556 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you a shortcut that takes you

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:47.458 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
straight into your run.  And if

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:48.893 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you prefer, you can just tell

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:51.762 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Siri to start a run, and off

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.832 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you go.  It's that simple.  

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:57.501 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 When you if out for a run, you

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:00.137 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
don't want to be distracted. 

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:01.972 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
So we give you just what you

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:04.775 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
need at a glance, your distance

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.945 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
or your pace, on a big, clear

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.013 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
screen.  And if you are the

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:10.414 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
type, though, who really wants

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:13.384 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a lot of detail, we've always

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:15.519 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
got advanced mode just for you.

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:15.986 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:18.489 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 But one of the biggest hurdles

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:19.924 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
that all runners face is

00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:22.893 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.528 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%

 Next up is iPhone.  

00:53:23.434 --> 00:53:23.934 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:30.874 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 iPhone is the industry gold

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:32.810 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
standard.  The phone by which

all other smartphones are

00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:37.247 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
compared.  The iPhone has

transformed the way we do

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.852 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
things every day, and in the

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:47.224 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
process, it's become truly a

00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
cultural phenomenon, touching

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.995 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
so many lives from people all

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:53.464 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
around the world.  And there's

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:55.566 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a reason why you see so many

00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:57.468 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
iPhones everywhere you look. 

00:53:57.468 --> 00:53:59.570 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
We've now sold over a billion

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:00.838 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%

 (Applause) 

00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:08.011 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
 This makes iPhone the

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
bestselling product of its kind

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.449 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the history of the world.  

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:15.152 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%

and services.  And, of course,

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:28.999 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the software that powers iPhone

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.168 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
is iOS, the world's most

00:54:31.168 --> 00:54:33.971 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
advanced mobile operating

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:35.672 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%

00:54:37.975 --> 00:54:42.479 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%

enrich your daily experiences. 

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:47.384 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
For instance, you can simply

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:48.952 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
just lift your iPhone to wake

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.054 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
it.  We've added Siri

capability for apps from the

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.526 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:54:55.526 --> 00:54:59.463 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
me a Lyft to SFO.  You can book

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.532 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a ride just by voice.  We've

00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:03.367 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
added even more intelligence

00:55:03.367 --> 00:55:05.002 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
through machine learning into

00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:07.304 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
our QuickType keyboard with

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.605 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
contextual prediction.  

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:10.641 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 Maps has been beautifully

00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:12.176 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
redesigned, and you can use

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.512 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
apps here as well to book a

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.080 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
reservation or book a ride, all

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.416 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
without leaving the Maps app.  

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:21.552 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 I'd like to take a moment and

00:55:21.552 --> 00:55:24.054 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
talk about HomeKit.  This is a

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:26.723 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
huge moment for home auto

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:27.691 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
automation.  This is the first

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.026 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
time that home automation has

00:55:29.026 --> 00:55:30.427 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
been integrated into a major

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:33.163 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
platform.  And it all starts

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.098 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
here with the Home app, which

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:37.301 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
makes it unbelievably easy to

00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:38.569 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
set up and manage devices

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:40.237 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
throughout the home, whether

00:55:40.237 --> 00:55:44.374 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
you are at home or away.  With

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:47.077 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
iOS 10, you can manage your

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.412 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
home right from Control Center,

00:55:48.412 --> 00:55:51.415 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
and with Siri as well.  

00:55:51.415 --> 00:55:53.150 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 And HomeKit now supports

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:54.451 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
accessories across all of the

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.452 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
major categories of home

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:57.988 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
automation, from garage doors

00:55:57.988 --> 00:55:59.656 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
to security to everything in

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:03.527 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
between.  And virtually every

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.996 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
major manufacturer of home

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:07.431 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
automation devices now supports

00:56:07.431 --> 00:56:09.132 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
HomeKit.  In fact, there's over

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:10.968 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a hundred products coming to

00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:13.470 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
market this year, and so many

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.472 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
more in the pipeline.  

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:19.176 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 All you have to do is look for

00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:22.546 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
this label, "Works with Apple

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.014 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
HomeKit."  They are super easy

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:25.916 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to set up and use with the new

00:56:25.916 --> 00:56:28.518 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Home app in iOS 10.  We are

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.886 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
really excited about HomeKit,

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:30.954 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and we think this is going to

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.289 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
be a really big deal.  

00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:33.257 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:40.964 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Now, we are also excited about

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.432 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Messages and the new features

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.501 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
in Messages.  You can change

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.469 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
the behavior and meaning of

00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:46.937 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
your message with these new

00:56:46.937 --> 00:56:49.306 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
bubble effects.  And now

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:51.508 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
there's some new full-screen

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.043 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
effects like confetti and

00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
fireworks.  And new stickers. 

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.015 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Just peel them, place them

00:56:58.015 --> 00:56:59.182 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
anywhere you want.  They are

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.684 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
available in the new App Store

00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:02.352 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
for iMessage, along with some

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.587 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
other great apps, and you can

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.922 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
easily use these apps to

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.424 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
create, to share content, to

00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.459 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
make payments, and more, all

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.661 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
without leaving Messages.  

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:14.765 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So, that's a quick update on

00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:17.901 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
iOS 10, the world's most

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:18.902 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
advanced mobile operating

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.137 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
system, with some incredible

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:25.809 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
new features.  Now, of course,

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:28.512 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the world's most advanced

00:57:28.512 --> 00:57:31.548 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
mobile operating system

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:34.051 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
deserves the most advanced

00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:41.658 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
smartphone.  And here it is.  

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:42.025 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.027 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:47.931 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 It's the best iPhone that we

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:52.602 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
have ever created.  This is

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.537 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
iPhone 7.  

00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:54.137 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

00:57:54.137 --> 00:58:05.048 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 It has a gorgeous new design,

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:06.917 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
and I'd like to have Jony tell

00:58:06.917 --> 00:58:08.552 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
you more about it.  

00:58:08.552 --> 00:58:11.421 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:19.096 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; JONY IVE: We have created a

00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:20.997 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
product that is the most

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.933 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
deliberate evolution of our

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:29.406 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
original founding design.  An

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:31.975 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
aluminum body and formed sheet

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:35.846 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
of glass describe a singular

00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.148 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
shape.  One made with very few,

00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:41.718 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
very precisely engineered pa

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:43.387 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
parts.  Our obsession remains

00:58:43.387 --> 00:58:47.924 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
to continuously simplify and

00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:51.561 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
improve.  From sculpting the

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:52.996 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
camera housing directly out of

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.465 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the aluminum body to embedding

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:57.134 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
the antenna within the

00:58:57.134 --> 00:58:58.568 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
enclosure, essentially making

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:01.538 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
it disappear, each refinement

00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:06.143 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
serves to bring absolute unity

00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:09.112 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and efficiency to the design.  

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:12.816 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
 To define one truly

00:59:12.816 --> 00:59:13.617 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
uninterrupted form, we've

00:59:13.617 --> 00:59:15.986 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
developed a whole new process

00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:19.489 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to achieve a high gloss black

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:22.426 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
finish.  This begins with

00:59:22.426 --> 00:59:25.429 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
rotational 3D polishing, a

00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:28.632 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
specialized compound flows over

00:59:28.632 --> 00:59:30.233 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the intricate geometries of the

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:33.503 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
housing, removing imperf

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.104 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
imperfections, establishing a

00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:35.539 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
seamlessness between materials,

00:59:35.539 --> 00:59:39.176 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and producing a pristine mi

00:59:39.176 --> 00:59:40.944 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
mirror-like surface.  

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:43.613 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 The enclosure then goes

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:46.383 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
through an anodizeation pro

00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:46.883 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
process, which creates a

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
protective oxide layer.  A

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.023 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
single-component dye is ab

00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:54.090 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
absorbed through a capillary

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.759 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
effect to ensure maximum

00:59:55.759 --> 00:59:57.260 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
saturation while actually

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.531 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
becoming part of the surface 

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:01.998 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
itself.  

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:06.636 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 Finally, a magnetized ul

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:07.537 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
ultra-fine ion particle bath is

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.506 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
used to polish the anodized

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:12.576 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
layer to a superior high shine.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:14.010 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.248 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 When complete, iPhone 7 is the

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:25.489 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
most singular, the most evolved

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:31.661 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.502 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 &gt;&gt; TIM COOK: We are so excited

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:41.471 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
about iPhone 7.  It makes all

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.007 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the things you do every day so

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.476 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
much better.  To tell you more

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:49.913 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
about it, I'd like to invite my

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:50.947 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
colleague Phil Schiller up to

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:57.687 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
the stage.  Phil?  

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.089 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; PHIL SCHILLER: Well, good

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.991 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
morning, everyone.  I am

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.460 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
excited.  I hope you are.  This

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.762 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
is -- yeah, somebody is.  This

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:08.198 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
is the best iPhone we have ever

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.600 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
made.  We are going to cover it

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.802 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
with ten major features.  We

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.437 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
are going to get right started

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:15.505 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
with number one.  You have

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.974 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
already heard about it -- the

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.809 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
design.  Tim and Jony have told

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.378 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you that there is a beautiful

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:24.915 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
new refined design for iPhone 

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.716 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
7.  It starts with this new

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:30.987 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
finish we call jet black.  It

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:31.922 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
is absolutely stunning.  

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:32.222 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:34.691 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 It is a high-gloss finish, so

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.893 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
it's a seamless surface between

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.695 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the glass and the aluminum back

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.565 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
all around.  It is a stainless

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
steel Apple logo.  The new

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.302 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
integrated antennas are built

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.404 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
so subtly you can barely see

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.905 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
them at all anymore.  And of

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.206 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
course, the enclosure creates

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.508 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the housing for the camera.  It

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.943 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
is a beautiful new design.  

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.645 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 There is a second new black,

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:58.214 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
we call it simply "black."  

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.282 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:03.787 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 It is bead-blasted aluminum. 

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:05.589 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
It diffuses light.  It is a

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:07.457 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
black logo.  And it looks very

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.526 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
cool, very high tech.  

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:11.561 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 The new iPhone 7 also looks

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.965 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
beautiful in gold, and in

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:18.134 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
silver, and of course, rose

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:18.535 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
gold.  

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:18.835 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:25.008 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Number two, something we use

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:27.577 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
hundreds of times a day, the

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.447 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Home button.  The Home button

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:32.215 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
is quintessential Apple desn.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.551 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 It is so simple yet so

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:35.986 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
powerful.  We use it throughout

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:37.554 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
our day.  We click it to go

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.589 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
home.  We double-click it to

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.391 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
bring in multiitasking.  We

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.893 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
hold it down to invoke Siri. 

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.528 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
We can program it through

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:46.896 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
accessibility.  You can put

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.865 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
your finger on it and read your

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.500 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
fingerprint with Touch ID.  You

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.569 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
can double-tap it to bring the

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:53.903 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
screen down in reachability,

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:55.038 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and of course, hold it near a

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.606 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
terminal to pay with Apple Pay.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.475 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 It does so many things for us,

01:02:58.475 --> 01:02:59.809 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and we've completely redesigned

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.411 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
it to make it more responsive,

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.979 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
more reliable, and even

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.481 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
customizable in iPhone 7.  

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:06.483 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, we've done this before. 

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.151 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
We've changed our input devices

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.686 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in big ways.  You may remember

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.121 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
with the iPod, it started with

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.757 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
a mechanical click wheel, then

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.925 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
we updated to an

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:16.526 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
electrotrostatic wheel, and it

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.662 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
was so much better.  We've done

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:21.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
it recently in MacBook Pro. 

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
We've brought out the Force

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.502 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Touch Trackpad, and it's the

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:27.437 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
best Trackpad we've ever had in

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:28.638 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a notebook.  And we are doing

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.973 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
this with the Home button. 

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:33.943 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
We've reengineered it.  It's

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.012 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
now force sensitive, solid

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.914 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
state.  It works together in

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.649 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
combination with a n

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.451 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
new-generation Taptic Engine. 

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:43.219 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
This Taptic Engine is more

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:45.021 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
responsive, puts out a wider

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.691 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
range of frequencies, and it

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.993 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
creates in real time an

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
incredible feel with the new

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.429 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Home button.  In fact, it's so

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:53.530 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
useful we use it throughout the

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:54.698 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
user experience.  So if you do

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:55.965 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a quick action, like moving a

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.801 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
widget, it gives you a nice

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:59.002 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
taptic feedback.  There's

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.470 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
unique feedbacks for

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:01.471 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
notifications and messages and

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:02.939 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
even your ringtones, and it's

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:03.840 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
amazing because it can be

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.675 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
programmed by third-party

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.676 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
applications, and the

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.244 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
applications that have started

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.646 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
to work on iPhone 7, taking

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:12.482 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
advantage of this Taptic En

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:13.416 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
Engine, are creating new

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.418 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
feelings and experiences that

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.087 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
could not have been created

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.121 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
before in a smartphone.  It's

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:19.456 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
really incredible.  

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.792 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
 Number three, the new

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.428 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
enclosure in iPhone 7 and

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.030 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
iPhone 7 Plus are water and

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.998 align:start line:85% position:48% size:43%
dust resistant.  

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:35.972 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Now, it's incredibly important

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.007 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to the team to ensure that we

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.476 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
protect the great feeling and

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.478 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
experience that we all love

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:42.078 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
about our iPhones with the

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.047 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
buttons and switches.  To do

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.582 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
that and provide this

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:46.983 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
resistance meant reengineering

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.518 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
it from the inside out in many

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:49.986 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
ways, including new seals and

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:53.223 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
new adhesives.  In our tests,

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.458 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
it is IP67 protection standard.

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.327 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 What does this mean for all of

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.996 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
us?  Well, even the least

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.064 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
coordinated among us don't have

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.999 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to worry in case some unusual

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:05.635 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
mishap happens that your iPhone

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:08.805 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
will be safe from water or d

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:09.038 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
dust.  

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:11.074 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:15.278 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Number four, let's talk about

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.412 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
the camera.  The camera is

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
perhaps the most beloved

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.516 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
feature by many of us in our

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.618 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
iPhones, and customers take

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.320 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
absolutely stunning photo

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:24.954 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
photographs.  You can see them

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:27.924 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
around the world in the Shot on

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:28.992 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
iPhone campaign.  They are

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:31.027 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
amazing, and they send us them

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.662 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
every single day, more pictures

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.464 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to be included in our campaign,

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:35.565 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
because it is an incredible

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:36.966 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
camera.  And just wait until

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:37.967 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
they get their hands on the new

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.236 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
camera system in the iPhone 7. 

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:43.606 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
It is a huge advancement in

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.009 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
photography for cell phones.  

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:47.577 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 Everything about it is

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.679 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
entirely new.  There's an

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:52.081 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
optical image stabilizer in all

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.585 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
iPhones, 7 and 7 Plus, helps

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:56.953 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
steady from shaking hands.  

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.121 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:05.228 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 There's a wider F 1.le

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.897 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
aperture lens that lets 50%

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:11.401 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
more light on the sensor. 

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.636 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
There is a new six-element lens

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.572 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
so you can get sharper images

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.540 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
edge to edge with that 1.8

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.577 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
aperture.  And there is an a

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.545 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
all-new sensor, large pixels,

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:26.416 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
60% faster and 30% more energy

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.585 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
efficient.  

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Even the flash is all new. 

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.488 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Our True Tone flash, in the

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.024 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
same aperture, now has four

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
LEDs.  It puts out 50% more

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.028 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
light, reaches 50% further, and

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.063 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the engineering team has come

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:41.397 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
up with this really cool

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.632 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
feature, a flicker sensor. 

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:44.500 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
What does that do?  The flicker

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.935 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
sensor reads the flickering of

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.437 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
artificial lighting and can

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:48.504 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
compensate for it in the photos

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:49.472 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and videos you take.  This is

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.574 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
really, really big in terms of

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:52.909 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
image quality.  

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.444 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 But behind it all is the

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.679 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
brains of the camera, the image

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.581 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
signal processor.  And this

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.616 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
enables so much of the unique

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:01.050 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
quality that we get in our

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.919 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
pictures we take with iPhone,

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:06.522 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and the ISP and the new chip in

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.124 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the iPhone 7 is twice the

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.593 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
throughput of our previous

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.428 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
versions.  What does this ISP

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.497 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
do?  Well, I am going to take a

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.065 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
quick walk-through of some of

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.434 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the things the ISP does every

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.636 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
time we take a picture.  

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.037 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 The first thing it does is

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:21.905 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
read the machine and uses

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:23.206 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
machine learning to look for

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
objects and people and bodies

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.408 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%
within it.

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.709 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Then it automatically sets

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.678 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
exposure, sets focus using our

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:30.813 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Focus Pixels, sets the color

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.015 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with white balance.  In fact,

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:34.017 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
for the first time, captures

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:35.451 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
wide color, cinema-standard

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.553 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
wide color.  It balances off

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.822 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
with tone mapping.  It does

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.557 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
noise reduction.  And even if

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.026 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
it needs to, it can take

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:44.994 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
multiple photos and fuse them

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.496 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
together into one to give you

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.463 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
the perfect image.  This

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:48.965 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
happens every time we take a

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:50.767 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
picture.  In fact, the ISP is

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.870 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
so smart it is performing 100

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:54.971 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
billion operations every time

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.739 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
we take a picture.  And it does

01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:01.978 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
it in just 25 milliseconds. 

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
This truly is a supercomputer

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.047 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
for photos.  

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:04.580 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:09.986 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 What matters most is the

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:11.387 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
pictures you can take with the

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.655 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
iPhone 7.  So of course, we've

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:15.458 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
given iPhone 7s to a number of

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
great photographers and asked

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:18.695 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
them to show us what's possible

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:20.096 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
directly with this incredible

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.497 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
camera, and they were so blown

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.833 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
away.  I want to use one quote

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.068 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
of what photographers had to

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:26.202 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
say about this.  Christopher

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.938 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Anderson said:  This iPhone is

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.406 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
going to be a part of any

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.442 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
professional's repertoire of

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.677 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
tools.  The camera didn't just

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.546 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
handle low light, it rendered

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:37.447 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the separation of colors in a

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.682 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
way that reminds me of film. 

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:44.220 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
Just beautiful.  That is

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.588 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
remarkable praise from a great

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.990 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
photographer.  So I am going to

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.591 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
show you a few pictures that he

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.625 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
and other photographers took

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:50.893 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
directly from iPhone 7, and

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:51.961 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
these have not been retouched

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.997 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
in any way.  So here's one. 

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:55.064 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
This is an absolutely beautiful

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:55.565 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
photograph.  

01:08:55.565 --> 01:08:56.065 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:08:56.065 --> 01:09:01.971 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 This is a high-speed camera. 

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.473 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
He is not floating there.  It

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.408 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
shows just how great it is and

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:07.010 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
how sharp the focus.  It takes

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.644 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
vebl pictures, whether you are

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.912 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
using black and white or color.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.115 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 And the colors, because we

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:14.017 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
capture wide color gamut images

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:15.585 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
now, are much richer,

01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:16.619 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
particularly in the greens and

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:18.921 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
some of the reds. 

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.089 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Unfortunately, from the slide

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.090 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
machine up to this projection

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.525 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
system, you don't get the full

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:23.993 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
breadth of the gamut of wide

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.528 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
colors, so what you are seeing

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:26.529 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
here, as beautiful as it is,

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.663 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
isn't as beautiful as it

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.132 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
actually is in the photo and

01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:30.366 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you can see it on your iPhone. 

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.436 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 And here's an example of l

01:09:33.436 --> 01:09:34.070 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
low-light photography.  So much

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.005 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
improved.  It's really great. 

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:36.939 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
So customers are going to love

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.574 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
taking pictures with iPhone 7. 

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:39.409 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
They are also going to love

01:09:39.409 --> 01:09:42.512 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
taking Live Photos.  They are

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:44.280 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
already fun, and they've gotten

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.082 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
even better with iPhone 7.  Now

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.784 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
we apply video image

01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.019 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
stabilization when you take a

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.888 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Live Photo.  You can edit them

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.423 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
after you have shot them, like

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.991 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
crop them or apply filters, and

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.859 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
developers can capture and edit

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:57.693 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
Live Photos within their

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.063 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
applications with iOS 10. 

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.197 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Developers are really excited

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:04.467 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
that in iOS 10 you can now

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.402 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
capture RAW DNG files directly

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:07.937 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
from the camera sensor and do

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.472 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
even more complex editing.  And

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:10.740 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for the first time with iPhone

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.176 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
7, they can also get wide color

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:14.710 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in their photos that they take

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.914 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
as well.  So, this is the best

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:19.782 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
camera we have ever made on any

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:20.049 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
iPhone.  

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.584 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We also have the best camera

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.453 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
we have ever had on the front

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:26.889 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
size as well.  There's a new

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.524 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.426 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for those selfies and calls we

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.528 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
make.  This is up from 5

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.530 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
megapixelss.  The sensor

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.765 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
includes new pixel technologies

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.967 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
we used on the back side, like

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.068 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
deep trench isolation.  If you

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.069 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
remember what that is, it helps

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.972 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
us get sharper images as the

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.574 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
pixels get closer together.  It

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:48.044 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
also captures wide color images

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:49.579 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
and does auto image

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.147 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
stabilization.  This shot you

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.482 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
see up here on the screen, that

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:53.516 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
was taken from the front-side

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:56.052 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
camera, unedited exactly, as it

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:57.053 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
can take a beautiful selfie.  

01:10:57.053 --> 01:11:00.156 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 So this is the iPhone 7 ca

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:01.924 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
camera, new 12-megapixel camera

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.025 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
system with optical image

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:07.063 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
stabilization, wider f/1.8

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:09.132 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
aperture; six elements in the

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:11.634 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
lens that senses 60% faster. 

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.636 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Now a quad-LED True Tone flash.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.538 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Our incredibly fast ISP and

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
wide color capture.  It is the

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.476 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
best camera ever in an iPhone. 

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:21.144 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:30.486 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 So, if you can't tell, I love

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:31.888 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
cameras.  I love them.  And

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:35.892 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
this has got me so excited

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.059 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
because if that is the best

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.060 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
camera we have ever made in

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.398 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iPhone, what is left for iPhone

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.699 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
7?  And this is what we are

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.969 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
doing on iPhone 7 Plus.  It's

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.772 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
plus a second camera.  There's

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:52.542 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
now two 12-megapixel cameras

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:55.077 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
built in to the iPhone 7 Plus. 

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:58.581 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
One has the wide-angle 

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:00.082 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
28-millimeter lens, the same as

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.952 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the iPhone 7.  The other is a

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.054 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
telephoto 66-millimeter lens. 

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.389 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Why have two complete cameras

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.057 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
with two lenses?  Well, to

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.492 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
explain it, let me show you a

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.894 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
traditional point-and-shoot or

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:12.929 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
DSLR and how the lens can work.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.463 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 As you know, we have many of

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.498 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
these cameras in our lives, you

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:18.601 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
can change the focal length of

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.403 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
your lens to zoom in.  That's

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:21.904 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
how we get a zoom feature.  And

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:22.939 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
that works great when you have

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:24.207 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
a large camera with a big lens

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.309 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
on it.  You can move in and o

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.109 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
out.  That isn't so great on

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.411 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
the lens you want to put in

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:29.845 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
something that goes in your

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.648 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
pocket or your purse.  So we

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.684 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
know with two cameras and two

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.019 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
different lenses, we can create

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.555 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
a zoom feature built in to the

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.490 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iPhone.  It takes an incredible

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.525 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
amount of hardware and software

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.093 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to do it in a way that we can

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.928 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
all enjoy, and the team has

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.063 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
done something remarkable.  So

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.432 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
how does it work?  The same as

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:51.067 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
before.  You go into the camera

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:53.536 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
app to take a picture.  But now

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:54.537 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
there's a new button right

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.606 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
there on the screen -- let me

01:12:56.606 --> 01:13:00.042 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
blow it up a teeny bit.  It

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.844 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
says 1x, right above the

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
shutter.  When you go to take a

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.114 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
picture, it is using the

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.916 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
wide-angle lens and taking a

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.017 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
picture as aels.  But now with

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.518 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
this button you can do one of

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:10.686 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
two things.  First you can just

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.422 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
tap it and it jumps to 2x.  Now

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:14.957 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you are taking a picture with a

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:15.658 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
telephoto lens.  You are

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:18.294 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
getting the same high-quality

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:19.562 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
12-megapixel picture with a

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.097 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
beautiful optical lens, no

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:22.064 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
software needed.  

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.499 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 The second thing you can do is

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:24.533 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you can put your finger on it

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.436 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
and drawing across it, and you

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:31.107 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
can zoom from 1x to 5x.  As you

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:33.009 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
go beyond 2x, you are doing

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:34.043 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
software zoom.  But now, since

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:35.444 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
it's starting with that

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:36.279 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
telephoto lens, the quality of

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:37.613 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that image is four times better

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:38.981 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
than before with software zoom.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:40.416 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 In fact, it's so much better

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.684 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
we decided to push it even

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:45.521 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
further all the way up to 10x. 

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:51.494 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
So now -- (Applause) 

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:56.499 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
So, as you see here, now with

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:58.034 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
iPhone 7 Plus, you can go from

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:01.704 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
1x to 10x, optical zoom at 2x,

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:03.306 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and great software zoom after

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:03.539 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
that.  

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.007 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 Here is an example of two

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.942 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
photos side by side.  The one

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.011 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
on the left taken at 1x, the

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.113 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
one on the right at 2x, both

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.648 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
with beautiful optical lens

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:13.983 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
quality, both are great

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.018 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
examples of taking low-light

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.153 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
pictures now with incredible

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:19.055 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
new cameras in iPhone 7 Plus.  

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.456 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So that's the camera on iPhone

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
7 Plus, joining iPhone 7, with

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.061 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
its great new zoom feature.  

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.430 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 There's one other use of this

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.733 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
camera that we challenged our

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.102 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
engineering team to do as an

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:34.070 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
extra credit project.  It

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.471 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
really was.  It's something

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.006 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
that is incredibly challenging

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:38.441 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
and takes a lot of amazing

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.209 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
invention, but what they have

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.044 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
been doing is astounding.  And

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.579 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
it's something that's a big

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.981 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
breakthrough in photography,

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.149 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and we want to give you a sneak

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:53.189 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
peek of this feature.  

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:54.490 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 To explain it, I am going to

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.625 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
bring up a picture.  This is a

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.294 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
picture taken with a very h

01:14:58.294 --> 01:14:59.161 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
high-end camera.  It will help

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.096 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
us illustrate the feature we

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
are trying to achieve.  Let me

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.065 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
bring up a picture.  You have

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.133 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
seen this beautiful portrait. 

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.202 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
The gentleman in the front is

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:07.703 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
pin sharp in focus.  That

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.705 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
background has a beautiful

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:11.374 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
blur.  This is called shallow

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.209 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
depth of field.  This is a

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:14.977 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
technique that's really useful

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:18.547 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for things like portrait ure. 

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:19.582 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
It's something that is

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:21.417 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
illustrative of a great camera

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:23.052 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
that has often a very big

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.620 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
sensor, like a full-frame

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.989 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
sensor, or a really big, fast

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:28.691 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
lens.  And the quality of that

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.059 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
background blur, that's what's

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:33.062 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
called Bokeh.  The higher the

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:35.131 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
quality of the bokeh, usually

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:37.466 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the more advanced and higher

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:39.001 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
quality the camera and lens

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.669 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
system.  The result is it feels

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.638 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
almost 3D, like the person is

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.039 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
popping off the screen.  It's a

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.474 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
really beautiful photo.  So our

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:46.575 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
goal is to try to do something

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:47.943 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
like this using the two cameras

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.513 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
in the iPhone 7 Plus.  What the

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:51.180 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
engineering team has been

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.014 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
doing, hardware and software

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.082 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
working together, is truly

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.583 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
remarkable.  What they are able

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.118 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to do is when we take a picture

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:59.488 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
is to use the ISP to scan the

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:00.990 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
scene.  Use machine learning to

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.191 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
recognize people and faces. 

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:04.727 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
And then create a depth map of

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.730 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that image from the two cameras

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.565 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and the software.  Keep the

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:10.833 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
people in the front sharp in

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:12.067 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
focus and apply a beautiful

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.235 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
blur to the background.  This

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.171 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
is a huge breakthrough in what

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:17.573 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
can be done on a smartphone in

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:18.174 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
photography.  

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:20.075 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So how do you do it?  Well, it

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.610 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
couldn't be easier.  Again, we

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.045 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
go to the camera app, you go to

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.548 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
take a picture.  Where you

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:26.549 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
normally select the style of

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:28.217 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
the picture, so panorama or

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.985 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
square, there's a new style

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:32.254 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
that says "portrait."  You

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.189 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
select portrait, it

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.757 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
automatically jumps to using

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.125 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the telephoto lens because that

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:38.527 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
56-millimeter lens is great for

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:39.929 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
portrait lens, and

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.363 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
automatically you see the depth

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.032 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
effect.  Now, what's remarkable

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:44.633 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
is that before you take a

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:45.868 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
picture, as you are looking at

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:47.303 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
your iPhone screen, you are

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:48.571 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
seeing that blur in the

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:49.338 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
background.  It is being

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.674 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
generated in real time as you

01:16:51.674 --> 01:16:53.175 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
are looking at your screen. 

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:55.144 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Even high-end DSLRs can't do

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.613 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
real-time deep depth preview in

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.114 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
their screens.  This is an

01:16:59.114 --> 01:16:59.682 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
incredible breakthrough.  

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:01.150 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Now I am going to show you the

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.085 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
first picture we've ever shown

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.055 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the world of a depth of field

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.556 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
photo taken from an iPhone 7

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.658 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Plus with this new feature. 

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.527 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Before I do, I have to come

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:13.562 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
clean on something because I

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.598 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
wasn't entirely honest before. 

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:16.565 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
The picture I showed you

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
before, this was I can at t

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.802 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
thaten on an iPhone 7 Plus.  

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:25.574 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:37.686 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
It is stunning.  We've given

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.687 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
some photographers early access

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:41.156 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to the 7 Plus and software

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.191 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
feature, and they have been

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:44.126 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
blown away by how it performs. 

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:46.128 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Let me give you one quote from

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.530 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
a photographer.  Jason Nocito

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.198 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
said I love the depth of field

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:50.533 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
capabilities and the ability to

01:17:50.533 --> 01:17:51.634 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
shoot fast without losing

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:53.135 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
sharpness.  This iPhone proves

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.603 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you don't need a five-figure

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.738 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
rig to be a great photographer.

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:57.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 This camera is gonna change

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:58.107 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
the game.  

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.075 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 Now, we are not saying to

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:03.479 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
throw out your DSLRs and that

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:05.514 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iPhone replaces all the DSLRs. 

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.649 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
What we are saying is this is

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:07.750 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the best camera we have ever

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:09.385 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
made in an iPhone.  This is the

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:12.087 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
best camera ever made in any

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.055 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
smartphone.  For many of the

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.623 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
customers who have it, it will

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:15.624 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
probably be the best camera

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:18.027 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
they have ever owned to date. 

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.361 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
But more importantly, it allows

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.229 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
them to create beautiful

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:21.564 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
pictures with incredible

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:22.565 align:start line:85% position:48% size:43%
creative tools.  

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.066 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 So let me show you two more

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.467 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
examples taken from the iPhone

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.570 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
7 Plus with its depth of field.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.705 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Here is another photo.  That's

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:34.643 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
absolutely beautiful.  One m

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:39.315 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
more.  It is an incredible t

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:39.949 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
tool.  It's not for every style

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.116 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
of picture you are going to

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.151 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
take, but for the ones you want

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.119 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to use it on, it's a pretty big

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:44.587 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
breakthrough.  

01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:47.022 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So, how will iPhone 7 Plus u

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:47.656 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
users get this great feature? 

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.091 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Simple.  It will be a free

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.093 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
software update later this year

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:53.662 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to all iPhone 7 Plus users.  So

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:54.630 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
that's the camera.  

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.930 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:18:54.930 --> 01:19:03.672 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 Next, let's talk about the

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.542 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Retina HD display.  The Retina

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:08.077 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
HD display is the best display

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:12.081 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
on any smartphone.  And in

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.249 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, they get

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.518 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
even better.  They are now 25%

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
brighter than the 6s and

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.222 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
6s Plus.  For the first time

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.858 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
they display wide color gamut,

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.627 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that cinema P3 standard colors.

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:26.762 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 And we do end-to-end color

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.097 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
management from the

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.164 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
manufacturer in the factory to

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:30.232 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the photos you take with the

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.634 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
camera to what you see on the

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:32.935 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
display are all color managed

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.703 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in a beautiful way.  And don't

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.238 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
forget we integrate within the

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:39.708 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Retina HD display our 3D Touch

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:40.876 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
layer.  This is an important

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.044 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
element of the user interface,

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:43.579 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
and in iOS 10, the team has

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
taken great use of this, so we

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.148 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
are going to use it more

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.049 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
throughout our day in very

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:47.383 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
powerful ways.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.084 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 So we wanted to show you one

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.319 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
example of an app taking

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.587 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
advantage of all of this,

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:53.155 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
taking advantage of the Retina

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:55.057 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
HD display and its wide color,

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:59.161 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
of the camera's built in iPhone

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.096 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
7, and of course, 3D Touch.  We

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.765 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
wanted to show you a photo app,

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
and who knows photos and apps

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.834 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
better than Instagram?  I am

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.102 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
very excited to bring up Ian

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.571 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Spalter, Head of Design at

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
Instagram.  Ian?  

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.675 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.009 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 &gt;&gt; IAN SPALTER: Good morning,

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.644 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
everybody.  I am excited to

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.545 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
share with you what we've built

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.047 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to take advantage of this new

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.815 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
iPhone's gorgeous wide color

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.583 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
screen and dual lens camera. 

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.052 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
About a month ago, we launched

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:24.186 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
a in you product called

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:26.021 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Instagram Stories, and we have

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.122 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
seen people sharing moments

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.257 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
ranging from their everyday

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.059 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
lives to behind the scenes at

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:32.528 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the Olympics.  So let's jump

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:34.163 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
into the stories camera using

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.265 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the new 3D Touch quick action. 

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:37.566 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
The first thing we love about

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.034 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
this new iPhone is this

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.537 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
beautiful zoom that goes o

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:42.304 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
optically into 2x without

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
losing any resolution.  We

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.774 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
built a new zoom UI with haptic

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.342 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
feedback so you can really feel

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.678 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
when you push into that digital

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.414 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
zoom.  But now let's take a

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:58.053 align:start line:85% position:50% size:21%
photo.  

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.054 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

01:20:59.054 --> 01:20:59.755 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:05.094 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 Thank you.  Check out how

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:06.128 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
bright and vivid the colors are

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.397 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
thanks to the new wide color

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:12.701 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
capture of the new camera.  So,

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.036 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
photos don't always capture the

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.304 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
moment fully, so with a tap of

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:18.507 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
a button, we used a live photos

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:19.641 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
API to quickly create a

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:21.777 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
boomerang to bring the moment

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:23.746 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to life.  You can also import

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
your existing live photos and

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.647 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
do the same thing.  

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:27.116 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 This is awesome, but we wanted

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.317 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to go a step further and really

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.985 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
take full advantage of this

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.286 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
wide color gamut screen.  So we

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:32.788 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
built a new filter to do just

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:34.156 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that by pushing into parts of

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:35.524 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the color spectrum that just

01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:38.127 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
weren't possible with sRGB.  So

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:41.530 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with this new filter, you can

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:42.698 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
see colors pop in a way that

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:44.233 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you've never seen before.  In

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.634 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
fact, we've updated all of our

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.035 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
photo filters to take advantage

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.271 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
of wide gamut, so no matter

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
what your favorite filter is,

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.106 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
you are going to be

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.241 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
experiencing all of your

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.076 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
Instagram photos in full,

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.010 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
vibrant color.  

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.310 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:21:55.310 --> 01:22:02.117 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 And finally, once you are

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:03.585 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
happy with what you've created,

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.286 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you can share the moment with

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.188 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
friends with a single tap, and

01:22:06.188 --> 01:22:08.123 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
then if one of them replies,

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.758 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
our iOS 10 rich notifications

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:10.993 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
show you the image right there

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:12.761 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
in the push notification.  

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.096 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 So this new version of

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.597 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Instagram will be launching

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.065 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
later this year, and we are

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:18.066 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
really excited to see what you

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:19.134 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
all create with Instagram and

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.402 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the new iPhone.  Thank you.  

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:20.702 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:27.075 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.545 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 &gt;&gt; PHIL SCHILLER: Six, let's

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:33.615 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
talk about audio.  First, we

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.684 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
use the built-in speaker in our

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:36.752 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iPhone all the time.  We use it

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:39.021 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to listen to music, especially

01:22:39.021 --> 01:22:43.025 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
with friends.  We listen to it

01:22:43.025 --> 01:22:45.194 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
to make FaceTime calls, watch

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.795 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
TV shows, watch movies, do

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.230 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
speakerphone calls.  It is

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:49.064 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
critical to our experience with

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:50.265 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
our phones.  And the speakers

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.534 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
we have built in to iPhone 7

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.203 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
and 7 Plus are a huge jump

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:56.905 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
forward in audio quality.  The

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.574 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
first time, there's stereo

01:22:58.574 --> 01:22:59.541 align:start line:85% position:48% size:28%
speakers.  

01:22:59.541 --> 01:22:59.842 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:05.547 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 One is at the bottom, the

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.583 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
other is at the top.  They

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.750 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
sound great in portrait and

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.885 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
amazing in landscape.  They

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:11.854 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
also put out twice the volume

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:14.957 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
of the speakers in the iPhone 

01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:16.592 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
6s and 6s Plus, and they sound

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.093 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
better because they have an

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.127 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
increased dynamic range.  So

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.629 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
you have to take a listen to

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:21.630 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
these incredible speakers. 

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.365 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
They really will blow you away.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:23.832 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:28.136 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Number seven, EarPods.  Apple

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:31.340 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
EarPods are the most popular

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.375 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
headphones in the world.  And

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.043 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, we

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.411 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
are moving to connecting them

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:39.081 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
over Lightning.  Well, why over

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:41.550 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Lightning?  Well, first you may

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:42.651 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
not remember -- I certainly do

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:44.753 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
-- but from the start, we

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.154 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
designed Lightning to be a

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:48.156 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
great digital audio connector. 

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:48.757 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Among all the other things it

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.592 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
does, it provides a digital

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.227 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
audio stream, it provides power

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.129 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to your headphones or speakers,

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:57.699 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
it provides content music

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:58.700 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
control right within its

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.168 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
digital connection.  And this

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.570 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
may surprise you, but there are

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.573 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
now in the world over 900

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:07.743 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
million Lightning-enabled

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:08.644 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
devices.  It is perhaps the

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:10.045 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
largest digital audio

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:11.613 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
connection in the world.  And

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.081 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
there are speakers and

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
headphones designed to take

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.183 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
advantage of it, and they do

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.818 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
great things.  Here's one

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
example.  This is from JBL. 

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.657 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
This is the Reflect Aware

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:24.226 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
workout headphone.  It's li

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:24.726 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
lightweight, affordable,

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.061 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
provides active noise

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.562 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
cancellation.  In fact, with an

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.530 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
app on your iPhone, it's

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.699 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
adaptive and you can adjust how

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:32.401 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
much exterior noise you want to

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:35.103 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
let in or not.  And it does it

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:35.604 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
all without batteries or

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:36.571 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
charging because it works

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:37.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
directly over that Lightning

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:39.308 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
connector.  Simply not possible

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:40.676 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
on just an analog port.  

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:42.144 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
 So we are taking the

01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:44.046 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
headphones in iPhone 7 and 7

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:45.580 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Plus to lightning, and we are

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.716 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
including them in the box with

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:48.717 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
each device.  

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:50.085 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 Now, we know there are people

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
in the world who do have some

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.022 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
analog old connected devices

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:56.024 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
out there.  So we have also

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.927 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
made this.  It's an adapter,

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:03.231 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Lightning to min phono adapter.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.534 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 We are going to include that

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:07.235 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the box with every iPhone 7

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.537 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
and 7 Plus as well.  

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:08.837 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:16.611 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Now, some people have asked

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:19.748 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
why we would remove the analog

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.316 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
headphone jack from the iPhone.

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.718 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 I mean, it's been with us a

01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:24.186 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
really long time.  

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:24.486 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Laughter) 

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:27.789 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 I am sure you know that the

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
source of this miniphono jack

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.561 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
is over a hundred years old,

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:34.563 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
used to help quickly exchange

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:36.164 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
in switchboards.  Well, the

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:38.033 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
reason to move on -- I am going

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:39.234 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to give you three of them, but

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:41.636 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
it really comes down to one

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:42.571 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
word -- courage.  The courage

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:44.139 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
to move on, do something new

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.375 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that betters all of us, and our

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:47.309 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
team has tremendous courage.  

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:50.379 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 So first, we've shown that we

01:25:50.379 --> 01:25:53.148 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
can use Lightning for our 

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.617 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in-box headphones and to adapt

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.752 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
to all the older devices

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:58.587 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
through analog interfaces, and

01:25:58.587 --> 01:25:59.955 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
it is a great connector for

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:01.623 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
doing that and is a very large

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.258 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
base of users who can all take

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:04.192 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
advantage of it.  

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 But second -- and this is

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.395 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
really important -- our

01:26:06.395 --> 01:26:08.063 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
smartphones are packed with

01:26:08.063 --> 01:26:09.231 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
technologies, and we all want

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:12.667 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
more.  We want bigger, brighter

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.236 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
displays; we want larger

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:15.637 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
batteries; we want faster

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.272 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
processors; we want stereo

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.974 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
speakers; we want Taptic

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:20.642 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Engines.  We want all of that,

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:21.710 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and it's all fighting for space

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.578 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
within that same enclosure, and

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:26.281 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
maintaining an ancient si

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:26.815 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
single-purpose analog big

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:28.417 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
connector doesn't make sense

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.618 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
because that space is at a

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:30.218 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%
premium.  

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:31.686 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 And third -- and I think this

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:32.754 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
is most important of all --

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:36.024 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
when you have a vision of how

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.325 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
audio -- the audio experience

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:39.094 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
can be, you want to get there

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:40.629 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
as fast as you can and make it

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
as great as it can be.  And we

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:43.265 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
do have a vision for how audio

01:26:43.265 --> 01:26:45.167 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
should work on mobile devices. 

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:49.037 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
And that takes us to our next

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:54.009 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
feature.  Wireless.  Up till

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:55.710 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
now, no one has taken on the

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:59.014 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
challenge to really deliver the

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:00.315 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
audio experience wirelessly

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.384 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
between your mobile device and

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.653 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
your headphones in a way that

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.687 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
takes advantage of the

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:06.822 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
opportunities to do something

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.557 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
new and do something great. 

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.125 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
And up till now, no one has

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:12.661 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
taken on the challenge of

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:13.662 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
fixing the things that are

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:15.063 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
difficult to do in those

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.365 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
wireless experiences and made

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.234 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
it easy so that we all want to

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.436 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
enjoy them.  And it makes no

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.338 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
sense to tether ourselves with

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.607 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
cables to our mobile devices,

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:26.575 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
but until someone takes on

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:30.712 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
these challenges, that's what

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
we do.  Our team at Apple has

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.015 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
worked so hard to create

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:36.318 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
something new that delivers on

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:38.053 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the opportunity of how good a

01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:39.221 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
wireless experience can be, and

01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:40.655 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
they've worked hard to deal

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.723 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with the challenges that have

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.625 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
been left there and no one has

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.795 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
taken on.  So that is why today

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:48.730 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
we are so excited to show you a

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
new product from Apple called

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.634 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
Apple AirPods.  

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:53.935 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

01:27:53.935 --> 01:28:01.109 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
 And here they are.  

01:28:09.184 --> 01:28:10.085 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 &gt;&gt; We believe in a wireless

01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:11.319 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
future, a future where all of

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.255 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
your devices intuitively

01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:19.628 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
connect.  This belief drove the

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:24.766 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
design of our new wireless

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:29.838 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 They have been made possible

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:33.208 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
with the development of the new

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:34.809 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Apple design W1 chip.  It is

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.112 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
the first of its kind to

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:38.613 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
produce intelligent,

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:40.215 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
high-efficiency playback while

01:28:40.215 --> 01:28:41.983 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
delivering a consistent and

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:45.620 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
reliable connection.  Infrared

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.189 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
sensors detect when each AirPod

01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:50.992 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
is in your ear, so they only

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:54.529 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
play once you are ready to l

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:56.031 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
listen.  Motion Accelerometers

01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:58.700 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
also respond to your touch,

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.602 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
allowing you to access Siri

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:03.104 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
with a double-tap.  When you

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:04.873 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
are speaking, voice

01:29:04.873 --> 01:29:07.108 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
accelerometers recognize the

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:10.245 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
vibration and source of your

01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:11.813 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
voice.  Then, working with a

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:13.915 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
pair of beamforming micro

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.884 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
microphones, reduce external

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:18.153 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
noise.  Each AirPod provides up

01:29:18.153 --> 01:29:21.590 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to five hours of listening on a

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:23.592 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
single charge.  While the

01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:24.693 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
compact wireless charging case

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:27.329 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
delivers more than 24 hours of

01:29:27.329 --> 01:29:29.197 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
battery life.  

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.867 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
 The W1 chip enables

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:33.702 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
intelligent connection to all

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.604 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
your Apple devices and allows

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:37.472 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you to instantly switch between

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:41.209 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
whichever one you are using.  

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.745 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 And of course, the new

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:45.146 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
wireless AirPods deliver

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
incredible sound.  We are just

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:52.687 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
at the beginning of a truly

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:53.655 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
wireless future we've been

01:29:53.655 --> 01:29:54.990 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
working towards for many years.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.461 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
, where technology enables the

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:00.795 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
seamless and automatic

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.397 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
connection between you and your

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:03.898 align:start line:85% position:50% size:25%
devices.  

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:11.506 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:21.616 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
 &gt;&gt; PHIL SCHILLER:

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:22.284 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
Congratulations to the team who

01:30:22.284 --> 01:30:23.752 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
has worked so hard on this.  It

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.186 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
is a breakthrough design.  The

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.721 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
AirPods deliver truly an Apple

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:29.691 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
magical experience.  When you

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:30.759 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
try it, you are just going to

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:31.626 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
be blown away.  

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:33.795 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 How do you set them up?  You

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:36.164 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
simply put a pair of EarPods

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:37.332 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
near your iPhone and open your

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:39.534 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
case.  The user interface pops

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.770 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
up and says Connect, and you

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:43.338 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
tap Connect.  That's it. 

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:45.106 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
There's no step two, nothing

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:47.275 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
else to do.  You simply con

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:47.842 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
connect.  And that one step

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.711 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
also connects you with your

01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:50.211 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
Apple Watch, so you are

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.346 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
automatically set up for both

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:52.681 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
your iPhone and your Apple

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.350 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
Watch.  You can start l

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.152 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
listening.  And as you have

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:59.154 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
playback on either device, the

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:00.655 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
EarPods automatically switch to

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.656 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
whatever device you are using. 

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.625 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
In fact, we also use iCloud to

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:05.660 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
propagate that setup across

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.195 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
your iPads and your Macs as

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.831 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
well, so one-step setup across

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.633 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
all your devices.  It's that

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:13.635 align:start line:85% position:48% size:18%
easy.  

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:15.236 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 They are an incredible audio

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:16.237 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
experience.  You can listen to

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.872 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
beautiful music in stereo, or

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.908 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
if you want to use one, just to

01:31:19.908 --> 01:31:21.776 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
talk to Siri or make a phone

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:22.844 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
call, it automatically routes

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.713 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the audio across whatever you

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:25.780 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
choose to do.  There's no

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.649 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
buttons.  There's no switching.

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:29.150 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 There's no pairing.  There's

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.252 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
no unpairing.  Those things are

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:32.854 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
of the past.  

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:35.857 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 And it all started with a

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:39.994 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
brand-new chip, W1 chip, Ap

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:41.162 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Apple's first wireless chip. 

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.897 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
And there's so much technology

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:45.133 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
packed into each AirPod. 

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:46.868 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
There's the chip.  There's dual

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:49.170 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
accelerometers, optical sen

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:49.604 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
sensors, beamforming

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:52.207 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
microphones, antennas,

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:54.275 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
batteries.  It is a tech

01:31:54.275 --> 01:32:01.649 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
technical tour de force in this

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.150 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
unique AirPod.  

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:03.685 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 There is a battery built into

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:04.686 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
the case so you can recharge

01:32:04.686 --> 01:32:05.620 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
directly from the battery in

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.822 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the case for up to 4 hours of

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:08.857 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
listening and then plug in

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:09.758 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
lightning once you want to

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:12.694 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
charge the case and the AirPods

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.262 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
together at once.  And they are

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.930 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
so small you will want to carry

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:18.700 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
them along with you everywhere.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.770 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Here they are alongside our

01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:22.637 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
wired EarPods.  

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.806 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 So that is the breakthrough

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.142 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
AirPods based on our W1 chip

01:32:27.142 --> 01:32:28.777 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
and, at the same time, Beats is

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:30.378 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
also coming out with a new line

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.213 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
of headphones all also taking

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:34.115 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
advantage of this W1 chip and

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.216 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
doing the same great work with

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
our software to make the

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.755 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
experience easy to use.  So

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:43.091 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
today Beats is launching the

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:45.693 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
new Beats Solo3 Wireless,

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.128 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
incredible audio quality to 40

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:48.263 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
hours of listening time using

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:53.234 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
that W1 chip.  And for wor

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.669 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
workouts, Powerbeats3 Wireless,

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.271 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
the best active headphones, and

01:32:56.271 --> 01:32:57.739 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
now they use our W1 chip as

01:32:57.739 --> 01:32:59.240 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
well for incredible sound and

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.309 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
battery life.  And an entirely

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.945 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
new line, Beatsx.  This is

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
affordable, light, comfortable

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.415 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
headphone for all throughout

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.451 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
your day.  Those three plus the

01:33:09.451 --> 01:33:11.953 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
new AirPods means now a br

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:13.121 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
brand-new wireless experience

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:14.255 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
for everyone regardless of what

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:17.091 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
kind of style of headphone you

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:17.725 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
want to wear.  

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:19.194 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 And that's wireless.  

01:33:19.194 --> 01:33:19.694 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 (Cheers and applause) 

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:29.704 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 Let's talk about Apple Pay. 

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.706 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Our customers love using Apple

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.007 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Pay.  And this is amazing.  In

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.676 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
the U.S., merchants tell us

01:33:34.676 --> 01:33:36.511 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
that over 90% of wireless

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:38.279 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
transactions on contactless

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.881 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
payment are now made with Apple

01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:42.717 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Pay.  It is a huge hit.  And

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.086 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
with the advances in iOS 10, it

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.855 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
gets even easier to keep all

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:47.889 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
your credit cards, your loyalty

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:50.191 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
cards safely in your Apple

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:53.328 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Wallet on your iPhone.  We are

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:54.696 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
trying to bring it around the

01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:55.830 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
world as quickly as we can, and

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.265 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the team is launching new

01:33:57.265 --> 01:33:58.266 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
country this is fall.  I want

01:33:58.266 --> 01:34:00.268 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
to talk about one of them,

01:34:00.268 --> 01:34:03.771 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Japan.  Yeah, we got a hoo

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.507 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
right out here.  Japan.  You

01:34:05.507 --> 01:34:07.475 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
may know that in Japan, they

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.210 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
use a different version of NFC

01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:10.845 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
called FeliCa.  So for the

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.814 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that we are

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:15.583 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
bringing to Japan, we are

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:17.452 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
including FeliCa technology, as

01:34:17.452 --> 01:34:20.288 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
well as Apple Watch Series 2

01:34:20.288 --> 01:34:21.689 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
will also include FeliCa

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:22.790 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
technology.  And with that in

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
place, then we can roll out

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.427 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Apple Pay in Japan, and we are

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:28.863 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
going to do that in October.  

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.832 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 At the same time, the Apple

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:32.267 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Maps team is going to roll out

01:34:32.267 --> 01:34:34.502 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
Transit in Japan, because

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.404 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
that's the perfect fit, Transit

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.939 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
in Maps, the ability to figure

01:34:37.939 --> 01:34:39.240 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
out what it's going to cost to

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.408 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
get on your route and to be

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.509 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
able to pay it automatically

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.845 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
with your Apple Watch or your

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:44.145 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
iPhone.  

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:46.281 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 So that's Apple Pay, and that

01:34:46.281 --> 01:34:47.582 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
particulars us to number ten.  

01:34:47.582 --> 01:34:47.882 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:56.724 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
 Honestly, I am almost

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:58.226 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
embarrassed that we have this

01:34:58.226 --> 01:34:59.193 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
one till last because this

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.895 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
easily could have been the

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.297 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
first.  It is performance.  And

01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:04.198 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
if you are paying attention,

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.067 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
you know Apple's chip team is

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:08.169 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
killing it in performance. 

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:09.237 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
What they are doing year after

01:35:09.237 --> 01:35:11.306 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
year is remarkable.  Every year

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:14.275 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
the iPhone is the fastest

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:15.176 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
smartphone in the market, and

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.412 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that's continued even to this

01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
day.  But what's happening

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.682 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
today with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:23.117 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
blows that all away because we

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:24.552 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
have a new generation chip in

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:27.822 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
the iPhone 7, and it's called

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:29.657 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
A10 Fusion.  

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:30.325 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:39.767 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 A10 Fusion is a 64-bit

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.869 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
four-core processor with over 

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:44.138 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
3.3 billion transistors.  It is

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:45.139 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
a rocket ship.  

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:47.842 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 First, it has two cores that

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:48.843 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
are high-performance cores. 

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.445 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
These high-performance cores

01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:55.249 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
run a full 40% faster than the

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:57.352 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
A9 chip in the iPhone 6 and

01:35:57.352 --> 01:35:58.653 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
6s Plus.  If you are coming

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:00.221 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
from an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:03.057 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
it's twice as fast than the A8.

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:03.191 align:start line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:04.859 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Here is what the team has been

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.494 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
doing over the years.  The A10

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.330 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Fusion now 120 times faster

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:10.965 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
than the original iPhone.  And

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
look at the last three years,

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.269 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
from the 5s to the 6, from the

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:17.438 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
6 to the 6s, and now the 7, the

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:18.806 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
jumps in performance are just

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:19.173 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
staggering.  

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:21.242 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
 I said there are four cores. 

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.477 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
The other two are what we call

01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:23.344 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
high-efficiency cores.  They

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:25.246 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
run at one-fifth the power of

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.347 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the high-performance core.  So

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.849 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
when you are doing something

01:36:27.849 --> 01:36:28.850 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
that isn't performance limited

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:30.752 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
by the CPU, like checking your

01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:32.286 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
email, that can run on the

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:33.554 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
high-efficiency core and get

01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:35.757 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
longer battery life.  So how do

01:36:35.757 --> 01:36:37.492 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
we decide what runs on which

01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:40.294 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
core?  There's a new Apple

design Performance Controller

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:45.500 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
that in real-time makes sure

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.801 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
processes are running for

maximum performance or maximum

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:48.736 align:start line:85% position:48% size:38%
battery life.  

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.705 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 In addition, we've got amazing

01:36:50.705 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
graphics in the A10.  It's a

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.144 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
new GPU.  It's a six-core

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.179 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
graphics chip that is 50% f

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:00.748 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
faster than the A9 and three

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.684 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
times faster than the A8.  This

01:37:02.684 --> 01:37:05.319 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
is remarkable.  And it does it,

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:06.754 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
again, with efficiency in mind.

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.690 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Two-therds of the power of the

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:11.192 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
A9.  Half the power of the A8

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:11.693 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
in graphics.  

01:37:11.693 --> 01:37:13.227 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 I've got to bring this chart

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:15.263 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
up as well.  240 times faster

01:37:15.263 --> 01:37:17.799 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
than the original iPhone.  The

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:19.167 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
graphics performance year over

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:21.235 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
year here is staggering.  If

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:22.370 align:start line:85% position:48% size:48%
you combine the CPU

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.705 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
performance, the graphics

01:37:23.705 --> 01:37:24.739 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
performance all running

01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
efficiently, and there is

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.842 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
absolutely no question A10

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.677 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
Fusion is the most powerful

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.846 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
chip ever in a smartphone.  

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:32.346 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:42.023 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 More importantly for all of 

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:44.892 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
us, A10 Fusion is going to

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:46.427 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
enable apps and titles that

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:47.695 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
were simply not possible in

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.464 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
mobile devices before.  For

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:03.444 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
advantage of the GPU.  It also

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:04.979 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
delivers graphics that use the

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:07.081 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
wide color gamut of the dis

01:38:07.815 --> 01:38:08.783 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
the stereo speakers and

01:38:08.783 --> 01:38:10.718 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
utilizes the Taptic Engine for

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:21.162 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 Pro apps benefit as well. 

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:23.331 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
This is Adobe Lightroom.  Adobe

delivers 90% of the features

01:38:27.969 --> 01:38:29.771 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
for raw editing of the desktop

01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:31.506 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
version.  I mean, that's

01:38:31.506 --> 01:38:33.241 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
incredible.  Adobe Lightroom on

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:34.742 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a phone in your pocket doing

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.210 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
RAW editing.  It's simply

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:36.744 align:start line:85% position:48% size:33%
incredible.  

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:37.812 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 We want to give you one

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.184 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
what it's capable of, so I am

01:38:43.184 --> 01:38:44.352 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%

 As mobile game developers, we

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:57.899 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
could not be more excited about

cinematic gameplay experiences

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.238 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that were simply not possible

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:13.414 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
you know.  A great darkness has

overtaken this once peaceful

01:39:16.751 --> 01:39:18.853 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
bridge to the witch's castle

01:39:18.853 --> 01:39:21.022 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
battling a scarecrow, who in

01:39:21.022 --> 01:39:22.390 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
our version of the Oz is very

01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:24.792 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
powerful.  We are able to do

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.260 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
things visually on the iPhone 7

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.428 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
that were simply not possible

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:28.896 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
before.  Note the real-time

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:30.198 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
reflections, weather effects,

01:39:30.198 --> 01:39:32.133 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
all stunning and expensive from

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:33.935 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
a CPU standpoint but running

01:39:33.935 --> 01:39:35.670 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
flawlessly on the iPhone 7. 

01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:37.672 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
And when Scott casts an

01:39:37.672 --> 01:39:39.307 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
earthquake, you will see we

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:40.274 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
even have been able to add some

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:45.213 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
really cool environmental

01:39:45.213 --> 01:39:45.847 align:start line:85% position:50% size:35%
destruction.  

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:47.281 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 Okay, Scott, let's finish this

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.984 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
monkey captain off.  

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:57.625 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
 The witch has a ton of

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.295 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
of Metal and the A10 chip, we

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:03.664 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%

 (Applause) 

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:12.740 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
One of the features we are

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.775 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
truly excited about is the wide

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.577 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
color display.  It is allowing

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:20.114 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
us to create extremely stunning

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:21.182 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
visual effects.  Now, although

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:22.383 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
it looks pretty good on this

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:24.051 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
screen, you really have to see

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.786 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
it on the iPhone 7 to see how

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:28.222 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
beautiful the game looks.  

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.291 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
 During the epic moments, the

01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:31.826 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
haptic feedback is allowing us

01:40:31.826 --> 01:40:33.661 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
to actually feel big hits, and

01:40:33.661 --> 01:40:35.229 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
the stereo sound is pulling us

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:36.197 align:start line:85% position:47% size:53%
even further into the

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:37.798 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
environment, all leading to an

01:40:37.798 --> 01:40:39.233 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
even more visceral connection

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:41.202 align:start line:85% position:50% size:50%
with our gameplay.  

01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:43.838 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 All right, Scott, let's cast a

01:40:43.838 --> 01:40:49.610 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
tornado and knock her back.  

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:51.812 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
Okay, I think it's time to

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:54.081 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
finish her off with Arcane N

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.850 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
Nova, one of Scarecrow's most

powerful abilities.  

01:41:01.122 --> 01:41:06.694 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
Join us in the epic journey to

01:41:06.694 --> 01:41:08.362 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
cast back the darkness when Oz:

 (Laughter) 

01:41:27.048 --> 01:41:30.151 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 Well, our A10 chip delivers

01:41:30.151 --> 01:41:31.285 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
performance and incredible

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:32.787 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
efficiency.  So here's the

01:41:32.787 --> 01:41:34.322 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
battery life numbers on iPhone

01:41:34.322 --> 01:41:36.457 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:37.792 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
life numbers across the board. 

01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:40.528 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
Wi-fi browsing, 14 and 15 ho

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:41.696 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
hours.  LTE browsing, 12 and 13

01:41:41.696 --> 01:41:44.732 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
hours.  Most importantly, our

01:41:44.732 --> 01:41:46.300 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
customers are going to be so

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.269 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
excited to learn that the

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:50.404 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:52.006 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
longest battery life ever in an

01:41:52.006 --> 01:41:53.307 align:start line:85% position:48% size:23%
iPhone.  

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:53.841 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:59.714 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
 And here's another way to

01:41:59.714 --> 01:42:01.182 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
think about battery life.  If

01:42:01.182 --> 01:42:04.151 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
you are upgrading from an

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7, on

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.355 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
average you can expect to get

01:42:07.355 --> 01:42:08.756 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
about two more hours into your

01:42:08.756 --> 01:42:10.057 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
day on your battery life. 

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.292 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
That's a meaningful difference.

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:12.259 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
 That's on average, some

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.694 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
customers many more than that. 

01:42:13.694 --> 01:42:15.396 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
And if you are coming from an

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:16.964 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
iPhone 6s Plus, which already

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.366 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
had great battery life, you

01:42:18.366 --> 01:42:20.801 align:start line:85% position:50% size:65%
will find an iPhone 7 Plus

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.503 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
delivers at least an hour more

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.705 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
battery life on average to, and

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:26.207 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
for some customers, again, much

01:42:26.207 --> 01:42:28.376 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
more than that.  So real

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:30.244 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
battery life difference you can

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:30.878 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
feel throughout every single

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:31.312 align:start line:85% position:50% size:16%
day.  

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:33.247 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
 So here is iPhone 7.  It is

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.648 align:start line:85% position:50% size:61%
packed with unbelievable

We are really excited to tell

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:20.908 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
you that iPhone 7 costs the

01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:22.776 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
same as the iPhone 6s that it

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:28.115 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
replaces, just $649.  And, it

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:31.752 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
comes in silver, gold, rose

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:33.354 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
gold, black, and the new jet

01:46:33.354 --> 01:46:36.156 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
black.  In these configurations

01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.925 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
-- no, not these -- we've

01:46:37.925 --> 01:46:39.493 align:start line:85% position:47% size:58%
doubled all the storage

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:43.464 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
configurations, so now it's 32

01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:47.301 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
gigabytes, 128 gigabytes, and

01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:48.736 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
256 gigabytes.  And jet black

01:46:48.736 --> 01:46:51.205 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
specifically comes on 128 and

01:46:51.205 --> 01:46:53.173 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
256 gig sizes.  

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:57.645 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 iPhone 7 Plus starts at $769. 

01:46:57.645 --> 01:46:59.813 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
It also comes in 32 gigabytes,

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:01.682 align:start line:85% position:50% size:56%
128 gigabytes, and 256

01:47:01.682 --> 01:47:03.183 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
gigabytes, and again, jet black

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:06.220 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
specifically on 128 and 256

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:06.820 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
gigabytes.  

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.722 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
 So now, this is our new iPhone

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:13.227 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
lineup.  It starts with iPhone

01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:15.763 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
SE.  We move the 6 and 6s down

01:47:15.763 --> 01:47:17.197 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to the middle of the line.  And

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.365 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
at the top of the line, the now

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:20.467 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  We are

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:21.802 align:start line:85% position:48% size:43%
going to keep two

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:24.738 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
configurations of the 6s and

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start line:85% position:45% size:73%
6s Plus around.  We are going

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:26.740 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
to do something we haven't done

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.909 align:start line:85% position:50% size:75%
before, upgrade the storage in

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.744 align:start line:85% position:50% size:70%
those as well to 32 gigs and

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start line:85% position:50% size:41%
128 gigabytes.  

01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:32.179 align:start line:85% position:50% size:31%
 (Applause) 

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:34.481 align:start line:85% position:46% size:68%
 We think customers at that

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:35.749 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
price range are going to really

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:36.250 align:start line:85% position:50% size:45%
appreciate that.  

01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:37.918 align:start line:85% position:47% size:63%
 Now, we know many of our

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.186 align:start line:85% position:44% size:78%
